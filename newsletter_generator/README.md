## Overview

This project implements an automated newsletter generation system that:
- Fetches articles from multiple RSS feeds.
- Processes articles with NLP techniques (TF-IDF, cosine similarity, keyword extraction).
- Matches articles to user preferences.
- Generates personalized newsletters in Markdown format.

## Features

- **Automated Article Retrieval:** Collects articles from a variety of RSS feeds.
- **NLP Processing:** Cleans, tokenizes, and vectorizes text for relevance and keyword extraction.
- **User Personalization:** Ranks articles based on user interests and preferred news sources.
- **Markdown Newsletter Generation:** Produces well-structured newsletters with summaries, categorized sections, and hyperlinked article references.
- **Modular Design:** Each component (RSS fetching, article processing, user management, and newsletter generation) is encapsulated in its own module for ease of maintenance and scalability.

```

- **main.py:** Orchestrates the overall process: fetching, processing, personalization, and newsletter generation.
- **rss_fetcher.py:** Retrieves articles from predefined RSS feeds and saves them as CSV files in the `data` directory.
- **article_processor.py:** Processes article text using NLP techniques, including text cleaning, TF-IDF vectorization, and keyword extraction.
- **user_manager.py:** Loads and manages user profiles (or creates default ones) and computes article relevance based on user interests and source matching.
- **newsletter_generator.py:** Sorts articles by relevance and creates personalized newsletters in Markdown format, saving them to the `output` directory.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/newsletter_generator.git
   cd newsletter_generator
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. **Install the required libraries:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the newsletter generator, execute the following command from the project root:

```bash
python main.py
```

This command will:
- Fetch articles from the configured RSS feeds.
- Process the articles using NLP techniques.
- Load user preferences.
- Generate personalized newsletters as Markdown files in the `output` directory.

## Testing

After running the program, verify the following:
1. Check the `output` directory for generated newsletter Markdown files.
2. Open any newsletter file to ensure:
   - A header with the user's name and the generation date.
   - A "Today's Highlights" section summarizing the top articles.
   - Categorized sections with article titles, summaries, links, and keywords.
3. Confirm that the content aligns with each user's interests and preferred sources.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following libraries:
- **feedparser:** For parsing RSS feeds.
- **newspaper3k:** For article extraction and parsing.
- **nltk:** For natural language processing tasks (tokenization, stopwords removal, lemmatization).
- **scikit-learn:** For TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity computations.
- **pandas:** For data manipulation and CSV operations.

Install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
