Barbara Plett Usher / BBC

The battered heart of Khartoum lies eerily quiet now, after weeks of intense urban combat in the Sudanese capital. We entered the city just days after Sudan's army recaptured it from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the culmination of a six-month offensive through the central part of the country. Once the commercial heart and seat of Sudan's government, Khartoum is now a burnt-out shell.

Inside the city left in ruins after two years of war

Taking back the capital was a turning point in the two-year civil war, which erupted out of a power struggle between the army and the RSF, and is estimated to have claimed at least 150,000 lives. But - as celebrations for Eid spill out into the capital's streets and people here consider the war to be over - it is not clear what direction the conflict will take now. We drove first to the presidential palace, which the RSF occupied early in the war. It was an important base for the paramilitary fighters. The floors are covered with debris and broken glass. Cushioned chairs once used for official functions stand covered with dust, a few paintings still hang on the walls, ragged chandeliers dangle from the ceilings. But almost everything else had been looted - even the electrical cables were yanked out of the walls.

Barbara Plett Usher / BBC The presidential palace, which was occupied by the RSF, was completely looted

The worst damage is at the front of the building, which was struck by RSF drones shortly after the army seized the palace. The main entrance is wrecked, dried blood still visible on the stairs, the windows now gaping holes looking out over the River Nile. ""I was really very excited to be in the Republican palace,"" one soldier told me as we walked down the grimy red carpet. ""It's my first time in this place and I waited for this place [like] the Sudanese in general. They wanted it to be free. It is symbol of our dignity."" It is also an important symbol of power for the army.

Barbara Plett Usher / BBC A restaurant delivered an Eid feast to celebrating soldiers at the presidential palace, who are being hailed as heroes by many

Soldiers sang and danced, their jubilation erupting as the Muslim Eid holiday began. A local restaurant delivered a feast for them, hailed as heroes by many in the capital. But their victory was won at enormous cost. The level of destruction in central Khartoum is stunning: government ministries, banks and towering office blocks stand blackened and burned. The tarmac at the international airport is a graveyard of smashed planes, its passport and check-in counters covered in ashes.

Barbara Plett Usher / BBC Khartoum's airport is right in the centre of the city and planes and terminal buildings have been badly damaged

We drove slowly, weaving around unexploded ordnance in the road. At one intersection body parts were in a heap, two skulls clearly visible. About 100m (328ft) down the road, a body lay in front of a damaged car. A stop at St Matthew's Cathedral, built by the British in 1908 and a place of worship for the country's minority Christian population, was a welcome reprieve. The beautifully painted ceiling is intact. A hole high in one wall showed where a shell had crashed through, a cross had fallen down. But it looked much better than many of the buildings we had seen.

Barbara Plett Usher / BBC Remarkably the inside of St Matthew's Cathedral, which is not far from the presidential palace, has largely gone untouched

A soldier cleaning up rubble on the floor told us that most of the damage was caused by shrapnel from shelling around the church. No-one destroyed the ""house of God"", he said, but the RSF fighters desecrated the building by defecating in it. He said his son was born on the first day of the war, but because of the non-stop fighting he had still not had a chance to go home and see the child. The paramilitaries also occupied the areas where diplomatic missions are located. When the fighting began, countries and companies scrambled to evacuate staff. At the entrance of the British embassy, an RSF slogan is scrawled on the wall. The bullet-proof glass of the building largely held, but it is pockmarked with many signs of impact.

Barbara Plett Usher / BBC A tattered union jack was seen near damaged buildings by the British embassy

In the car park at the back, a fleet of vehicles stands destroyed. Across the street, a UK flag hung over the staircase of a battered building, crumpled and dirty. This is Sudan's third civil war in 70 years, and in some ways, it is worse than any of the others - as previous conflicts were fought in other parts of the country. But this one has torn through the core of Sudan, hardening divisions and threatening to split the nation. Further away from the combat zone, scattered celebrations for Eid spilled into the street. For people here the war is over, even though it continues elsewhere.

Barbara Plett Usher / BBC Khartoum residents have been dressing up and celebrating Eid for the first time in two years, including these women at a local soup kitchen

The army has been accused of atrocities, and reports say tens of thousands fled the fighting in recent days. But in Khartoum, people celebrated the end of the brutal RSF occupation. The mood was also buoyant at a communal kitchen in the neighbourhood of al-Jeraif West. ""I feel like I've been re-created,"" said Osman al-Bashir, his eyes lighting up with the new reality after citing a list of the war's hardships. He told me he had learned his English from the BBC World Service. Duaa Tariq is a pro-democracy activist, part of the movement that in 2019 toppled military leader Omar al-Bashir, whose authoritarian rule had lasted nearly three decades.

She has been focusing on helping her neighbourhood survive the war. ""We're celebrating Eid for the first time in two years,"" she said. ""Everybody's dressing up, including myself! I'm overwhelmed with a lot of emotions, just like trying to learn how to live again. We feel free, we feel light, even the air smells different."" Ms Tariq struggled to keep the kitchens running during the war as food ran out, the city looted by the RSF, under siege by the army and US aid cut. Food is still scarce, but there is hope now.

""I'm feeling wonderful. I feel safe. I feel great, even though I'm hungry,"" said an elderly man, Kasim Agra. ""You know, it doesn't matter. Freedom is what's important. ""As you see, I carry a mobile,"" he said, pointing to a phone in his pocket. ""You couldn't carry a mobile about two weeks ago."" That is something many people in different parts of Khartoum have said to me - mobile telephones were a lifeline to the outside world, and a prime target for theft by RSF fighters.

Barbara Plett Usher / BBC Despite feeling hungry Khartoum resident Kasim Agra is revelling in the feeling of freedom, carrying a mobile phone - and is hopeful the city will be rebuilt

Mr Agra was optimistic that Khartoum, and the country, could recover. ""I think the government is going to bring investors: Americans, Saudis, Canadians, Chinese, they're going to rebuild this country, I believe."" Even if such massive reconstruction takes place, it is hard to imagine Khartoum retaining its distinct cultural and architectural features. Several of the women also echoed something I have repeatedly heard elsewhere - they can finally sleep again, after lying awake nights afraid that RSF looters would break in. The weight of fear and loss is heavy: so many stories of abuse, of life endangered and disrupted.

Barbara Plett Usher / BBC Rebuilding Khartoum will be a mammoth task - and the psychological impact on its residents will also be a challange

""Our children are traumatised,"" says Najwa Ibrahim. ""They need psychiatrists to help them. My sister's a teacher and tried to work with the children, but it's not enough."" Ms Tariq also has questions about the impact of the war: ""When will the city be accessible again, open again? ""And another personal question as an activist, what will happen to all the freedoms and rights that we gained over the past five years of revolution?"" she asked, referring to the years that followed the ousting of Bashir when a joint civilian-military government had been working towards a return to civilian rule. ""How will it be again for civil society, actors, for activists, for freedom fighters? I'm not sure of our future now."" No-one is sure of Sudan's future. ""We pray for the people of Darfur,"" 16-year-old Hawaa Abdulshafiea said, referring to the western stronghold of the RSF, where the humanitarian crisis has been worst, and where the focus of the war is expected to shift. ""May God protect them.""

Watch: Luigi Mangione is arraigned in New York earlier this year

US prosecutors will seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of shooting dead UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement on Tuesday that she had directed federal prosecutors to seek the penalty for the ""premeditated, cold-blooded assassination"". Mr Thompson was shot dead outside a hotel in New York on 4 December. Police arrested Mr Mangione, 26, days later in Pennsylvania after a nationwide manhunt. He has pleaded not guilty to state charges, and has yet to enter a plea for separate federal charges. He is currently awaiting trial in a New York prison.

In the press release, Bondi said Mr Thompson's murder ""was an act of political violence"" and that it ""may have posed grave risk of death to additional persons"" nearby. Investigators say Mr Mangione was motivated to kill Mr Thompson, 50, because of anger with US healthcare insurance companies. A lawyer for Mr Mangione called the decision ""barbaric"", accused the government of ""defending the broken, immoral, and murderous healthcare industry"", and said Mr Mangione was caught in a tug-of-war between state and federal prosecutors. ""While claiming to protect against murder, the federal government moves to commit the pre-meditated, state-sponsored murder of Luigi,"" said Karen Friedman Agnifilo in a statement. Mr Mangione is facing 11 state criminal counts in New York, including first-degree murder and murder as a crime of terrorism. If convicted of all the counts, he would face a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. But federal prosecutors have also separately charged Mr Mangione for using a firearm to commit murder and interstate stalking resulting in death. These charges make him eligible for the death penalty. Prosecutors have said the federal and state cases will move forward parallel with one another.

France's far right calls for Paris rally in support of Le Pen,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd31gm82gno,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 17:35:39 GMT",BBC World News,General,"France's far right calls for Paris rally in support of Le Pen

Jordan Bardella (R) said a rally would take place in the centre of Paris on Sunday

The Paris Court of Appeal said on Tuesday it should be able to provide a decision on the case by the summer of 2026 - several months ahead of the 2027 election.

Bardella, the president of the National Rally (RN) party, said the French had to be ""outraged"" by the sentence.

Le Pen's bid to become France's next president in 2027 was dealt a dramatic blow on Monday, when judges said she had been at the heart of an operation which saw the embezzlement of €2.9m ($3.4m; £2.5m) of EU funds between 2004 and 2016.

French far-right leader Jordan Bardella has called on people to rally in the centre of Paris on Sunday in protest at a ruling that has banned Marine Le Pen from running for public office for five years.

""We'll take to the streets this weekend,"" Bardella said during a press conference on Tuesday, with a call for ""democratic, peaceful, calm mobilisations"". The first event is planned for Place Vauban close to the Eiffel Tower on Sunday.

Sitting beside him, Le Pen said a ""nuclear bomb"" had been used used against the RN to stop the party getting into power.

The longtime figurehead of the French far right added that the ""system"" had used a ""powerful weapon"" against the RN, ""evidently because we are about to win the elections"".

""We won't let them get away with it,"" she added. People had to use their ""outrage and hurt"" to motivate them to persevere: ""We will hold on until the end, until victory.""

Earlier on Tuesday, Bardella condemned the ""tyranny of the judges"" and said that ""everything was being done to stop us from getting to power"".

He also criticised the insults that the judges have received since handing down the sentence on Monday, as did Le Pen, who said any threats to magistrates were ""unacceptable"".

They were echoing Rémy Heitz, the prosecutor general at the Court of Cassation - the highest court in France - who said earlier on Tuesday that there had been ""very personalised attacks"" and threats against the three judges who had determined Monday's verdicts.

Citing a police source, newspaper Le Figaro reported that Bénédicte de Perthuis, the president judge in the Le Pen case, had been placed under protection following threats.

Le Pen was gearing up to run for the presidency for a fourth time and had a good chance of winning. She is clearly reluctant to hand the baton to Jordan Bardella, who at 29 is seen by some as lacking the experience necessary to hold France's highest office.

Since she has been ruled ineligible, Le Pen has said she will not ""let herself be eliminated like this"". Bardella has steered clear of being drawn into the discussion at this stage, refusing to say whether he was National Rally's ""plan B"".

However, RN spokesman Laurent Jacobelli said that although the party would fight to have Le Pen as candidate, Bardella was ""the most naturally legitimate"" alternative.

Voters may agree. A poll published a day before Le Pen was sentenced showed that around 60% of RN voters would back Bardella over Le Pen at the presidential election if he were to run, and that he would come out top with up to 36% of the total vote.

Le Pen has garnered the support of several rightwingers in Europe and beyond, including Hungary's Viktor Orban and US President Donald Trump, who said her conviction was a ""very big deal"".

And Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said ""no-one who cares about democracy can rejoice at a sentence that... deprives millions of citizens of representation"".

On top of the ban on running for public office, Le Pen was also handed a €100,000 (£82,635) fine and four-year prison sentence, of which two will be suspended.

This will not apply until the appeals process is exhausted, which could take several years.","France's far right calls for Paris rally in support of Le Pen

Putin begins biggest Russian military call-up in years,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36718p52eyo,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 16:42:21 GMT",BBC World News,General,"Putin begins biggest Russian military call-up in years

Vladimir Putin was pictured last month reportedly visiting the Russian border region of Kursk in military fatigues

Vice Adm Vladimir Tsimlyansky said the new conscripts would not be sent to fight in Ukraine for what Russia calls its ""special military operation"".

That is a rise of 180,000 over the coming three years.

The spring call-up for a year's military service came several months after Putin said Russia should increase the overall size of its military to almost 2.39 million and its number of active servicemen to 1.5 million.

President Vladimir Putin has called up 160,000 men aged 18-30, Russia's highest number of conscripts since 2011, as the country moves to expand the size of its military.

However, there have been reports of conscripts being killed in fighting in Russia's border regions and they were sent to fight in Ukraine in the early months of the full-scale war.

The current draft, which takes place between April and July, comes despite US attempts to forge a ceasefire in the war.

There was no let-up in the violence on Tuesday, with Ukraine saying that a Russian attack on a power facility in the southern city of Kherson had left 45,000 people without electricity.

Although Russia has turned down a full US-brokered ceasefire with Ukraine, it says it did agree to stop attacking Ukraine's energy facilities. In an apparent attempt to deny Moscow had broken the terms of that deal, Russian officials said they had told Putin that Ukrainian drones had carried out attacks with little sign of a break.

Russia calls up conscripts in the spring and autumn but the latest draft of 160,000 young men is 10,000 higher than the same period in 2024.

Since the start of last year, the pool of young men available for the draft has been increased by raising the maximum age from 27 to 30.

As well as call-up notices delivered by post, Russia's young men will be receiving notifications on the state services website Gosuslugi.

In Moscow there were reports that call-ups had already been sent out on 1 April via the mos.ru city website.

Increasing numbers of Russians are trying to avoid the army by taking on ""alternative civilian service"". But human rights lawyer Timofey Vaskin warned on independent Russian media that every new call-up since the start of the war had become a lottery: ""Authorities are coming up with new forms of refilling the army.""

Quite apart from its twice-yearly draft, Russia has also called up large numbers of men as contract soldiers and recruited thousands of soldiers from North Korea.

Moscow has had to respond to extensive losses in Ukraine, with more than 100,000 verified by the BBC and Mediazona as soldiers killed in Ukraine.

The true number could be more than double.

Putin has scaled up the size of the military three times since he ordered troops to capture Ukraine in February 2022.

Russia's defence ministry linked the December 2023 increase in the size of the military to ""growing threats"" from both the war in Ukraine and the ""ongoing expansion of Nato"".

Nato has expanded to include Finland and Sweden, as a direct result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Finland has Nato's longest border with Russia, at 1,343km (834 miles) and Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said on Tuesday that his country would join other states neighbouring Russia in pulling out of the Ottawa convention banning anti-personnel mines.

Poland and the Baltic states made similar decisions two weeks ago because of the military threat from Russia.

Orpo said the decision to resume using anti-personnel mines was based on military advice, and that the people of Finland had nothing to worry about.

The government in Helsinki also said defence spending would be increased to 3% of economic output (GDP), up from 2.4% last year.","Putin begins biggest Russian military call-up in years

Israel PM attacks Qatar probe as 'witch hunt' after aides arrested,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ev9xq0408o,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 17:43:53 GMT",BBC World News,General,"Israel PM attacks Qatar probe as 'witch hunt' after aides arrested

EPA Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the police of holding the two men as ""hostages""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denounced an investigation into possible links between his aides and Qatar as a ""witch hunt"", after he gave testimony to police. An adviser and a former spokesman were arrested on Monday over alleged payments from the Gulf Arab state as part of the probe, which has been dubbed ""Qatar-gate"". They have denied any wrongdoing. Netanyahu, who has not been named as a suspect, accused the police of holding the two men as ""hostages"", adding: ""There is no case."" A Qatari official also dismissed the probe as a ""smear campaign"" against Qatar, which has played a key role as a mediator between Israel and Hamas during the war in Gaza.

It comes as Netanyahu faces escalating protests in Israel over his policies, including the resumption of Israel's offensive against Hamas before securing the release of all the remaining hostages, the dismissal of the director of the Shin Bet internal security agency, and the advancement of a controversial plan to overhaul the judiciary.

On Monday, Israel's police force announced that two suspects had been detained as part of an investigation into ties between the prime minister's office and Qatar. It provided no further details, citing a court-imposed gag order on the case. Israeli media reports subsequently identified them as Yonatan Urich, a very close adviser to Netanyahu, and Eli Feldstein, a former spokesman in the prime minister's office, and said they were suspected of contact with a foreign agent, money laundering, bribery, fraud, and breach of trust. Netanyahu later cut short an appearance at his separate trial on corruption charges, which he denies, to provide recorded testimony to police investigating the case at his office in Jerusalem. After being questioned, Netanyahu posted a video online in which he condemned both the arrests and the wider investigation. ""I understood that it was a political investigation but I didn't realise how political it was,"" he said. ""They are holding Jonatan Urich and Eli Feldstein as hostages, making their lives miserable over nothing."" ""There is no case, there is absolutely nothing, just a political witch hunt, nothing else."" The prime minister's Likud party also issued a statement accusing the attorney general's office and the Shin Bet chief of ""fabricating"" the case and attempting to ""terrorise Yonatan Urich in order to extract from him false testimony against the prime minister through blackmail"". On Tuesday, a judge at Rishon LeZion Magistrates' Court extended Urich and Feldstein's detention by three days, saying there were ""reasonable suspicions"" that required a thorough investigation. The police had requested a nine-day extension. Judge Menahem Mizrahi said in a decision that investigators suspected that the two men had acted to ""promote Qatar in a positive light"" and ""spread negative messages about Egypt"" and its role as another mediator in the Gaza ceasefire talks. For this purpose, the judge said, a ""business and economic connection"" was created between a US lobbying firm working for Qatar ""through the mediation of [Urich] in return for monetary payments which were passed to [Feldstein]"" through an Israeli businessman. Last week, Israeli media published a recording in which the businessman was heard saying that he had transferred funds to Feldstein on behalf of a US lobbyist working for Qatar. At the time, Feldstein's lawyers said the payments were ""for strategic and communications services Feldstein provided to the prime minister's office, not for Qatar"". They also said Feldstein was not aware of any connection between the businessman and other parties, including Qatar. Ulrich's lawyers said he denied involvement. A police representative told Judge Mizrahi on Tuesday that Urich was also suspected of passing journalists messages from a source linked to Qatar, which were presented as if they came from senior Israeli political or security officials. Ulrich's legal team, which includes Netanyahu's defence lawyer Amit Hadad, said they would submit a request to lift the gag order on the case to expose ""the injustice done to him"". The judge went on to approve the request, saying the gag order had been repeatedly violated.","Israel PM attacks Qatar probe as 'witch hunt' after aides arrested

Druse Militia Refuse to Join Syria’s New Army,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/world/middleeast/syria-israel-border.html,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 09:00:38 +0000",The New York Times,General,"Since January, several of the strongest Druse militias had been in talks with the government about their conditions for joining the new army. They were skeptical over the interim president’s pledges to protect the rights of Syria’s many religious and ethnic minorities.

Those talks stalled last month after an outburst of violence against another religious minority, heightening the concerns of the Druse. The violence began with an attack by remnants of the old regime on the new government’s security forces in a region dominated by the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam. Mr. al-Assad’s family are Alawites, and during the family’s five decades ruling Syria, they often prioritized members of the sect in security and military jobs.

The government responded by mobilizing its security forces, which other armed groups and armed civilians joined, according to witnesses and rights groups. These fighters — some nominally under the government’s control and others outside it — killed hundreds of Alawite civilians in what the rights groups said were sectarian-driven attacks.

Druse militia leaders have also accused the interim president, Ahmed al-Shara, of monopolizing power. Mr. al-Shara and many in his cohort were part of an Islamist rebel group, dominated by members of Syria’s Sunni Muslim majority, that was once linked to Al Qaeda. They showed little willingness initially to cede power in their new government to minorities.","Since January, several of the strongest Druse militias had been in talks with the government about their conditions for joining the new army.

Mr. Netanyahu had backed Eli Sharvit, a former commander of Israel’s navy, to lead the Shin Bet intelligence agency after he dismissed his predecessor, Ronen Bar. But the Israeli leader dropped Mr. Sharvit a day after the Monday announcement amid a backlash from the right, partly because he had written a column two months ago criticizing Mr. Trump for rolling back policies to fight climate change.

This news might be alarming if you’re one of the over 150 million customers in the U.S. who use Zelle for person-to-person payments. But only about 2% of transactions take place via Zelle’s app, which is why the company is discontinuing its stand-alone app.

Most consumers access Zelle via their bank, which then allows them to send money to their phone contacts. Zelle users who relied on the stand-alone app will have to re-enroll in the service through another financial institution.

Given the small user base of the Zelle app, it makes sense why the company would decide to get rid of it — maintaining an app takes time and money, especially one where people’s financial information is involved.

Zelle launched in 2017 with backing from 30 banks to be a more efficient alternative to Venmo. On Venmo, users can receive payments into their own Venmo wallet, which they can then deposit into their actual bank account — but if you don’t want to wait a few days for the deposit to process, you’ll have to pay a fee for an instant transfer. Because of Zelle’s connections with banks, it’s able to offer instant transfers without charging additional fees.

Zelle said that in 2024, users sent $1 trillion in payments, breaking the record of any other payment app. This might be the case because consumers tend to use Zelle for larger payments like rent. Venmo, on the other hand, is designed for more social use, like reimbursing a friend for dinner.","Zelle is shutting down its stand-alone app on Tuesday, according to a company blog post.

The app, which is backed by Mark Cuban and others, is now one of many to build on top of the AT Protocol — the same technology that underpins the social network Bluesky and a growing number of other apps.

Developed by co-founders Tori White (CEO) and Reed Hermeyer (CTO), Skylight offers a short-form video app experience with many familiar features, including an in-app video editor; the ability to comment, like, and share videos; set up your own user profile; and follow others.

Because it’s also built on the AT Protocol (or “ATProto” for short), users will immediately be tapped into Bluesky’s network of over 33.8 million users. That means videos posted on Skylight can be seen and engaged with by users on Bluesky and other ATProto-based apps, like the more photo-centric app Flashes, for example.

The company is funded by a pre-seed round from Cuban, who said earlier this year that he wanted to fund a TikTok alternative built on the AT Protocol. Leslie Feinzaig’s Graham & Walker Venture Fund also invested.

White, who used to be a travel influencer and is now a self-taught software developer living in Seattle, says she and co-founder Hermeyer were inspired to create Skylight when they first heard that TikTok was getting banned in the U.S.

In preparation for the ban, which is currently on pause, White had backed up her TikTok videos. But she still worried about losing access to her community and comments. She and Hermeyer had already been playing around with ATProto and saw the potential.

“The first thing that interested us about ATProto was that Bluesky was not failing,” Hermeyer told TechCrunch at the ATmosphere Conference in Seattle in March. “We didn’t see the ‘fail whale,’” he said, a reference to the graphic that appeared in Twitter’s early days when the app was constantly crashing. “That made us feel comfortable about the underlying technology.”

Hermeyer and White soon realized this was an ideal time to build a new social app on the protocol that could be “ban-proof.”

Tapping into her influencer background, White began documenting Skylight’s development on TikTok, which helped bring exposure to the product and build a following of potentially interested users.

“We started with distribution,” White explained. “I actually made a video before we ever wrote a line of code for this … [so] everyone can follow our journey as we build,” she told TechCrunch at the conference. “We were like, oh my gosh, we are building this thing that we think is so cool, but no one cares yet. So we have to build a way to tell people about it so that they would care, because we know people need it,” she said.

Today, White’s @buildwithtori TikTok profile has nearly 50,000 followers, many of which turned into early testers.

Like Bluesky, Skylight supports video uploads of up to three minutes in length, a recent increase from the one-minute-long videos supported previously. But White sees Skylight becoming more than just a decentralized TikTok clone.

She hints that Skylight in the future will allow users to customize their feed, including by utilizing new gestures beyond swiping and scrolling.

Other features in the works include support for sounds, duets, stitching, bookmarks, and playlists.

The app is in beta on the Google Play Store and is now available publicly on Apple’s App Store after initial testing.","Skylight, a startup taking on TikTok with a more open alternative, is launching its mobile app to the public on Tuesday after just 10 weeks of active development.

Meta’s head of AI research plans to leave the company,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/01/metas-head-of-ai-research-plans-to-leave-the-company/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 17:23:14 +0000",TechCrunch,Technology,"In Brief

Meta’s VP of AI research, Joelle Pineau, is planning to leave the company, she announced in a post on Facebook Tuesday. Pineau said she’s leaving in May after more than two years overseeing FAIR, Meta’s internal AI research lab led by Yann LeCun.

Pineau’s exit comes as Meta ramps up its AI efforts, with the company planning to spend $65 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025.

In a statement to Bloomberg News, a Meta spokesperson said the company does not have an immediate replacement for Pineau but is conducting a search for her successor. Last year, Meta reportedly reorganized the company to have its AI research unit report to the company’s chief product officer, Chris Cox.

As for Pineau, the executive said she’ll take some time off before jumping into an unnamed “new adventure.”","In Brief

TikTok is shutting down its Instagram competitor TikTok Notes,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/01/tiktok-is-shutting-down-its-instagram-competitor-tiktok-notes/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 17:06:50 +0000",TechCrunch,Technology,"TikTok is shutting down its Instagram competitor, TikTok Notes, on May 8. The photo-sharing app launched in testing in Canada, Australia, and Vietnam last year.

The company is notifying TikTok Notes users of its decision to retire the app and is directing them to ByteDance-owned Lemon8, which isn’t surprising given that the apps are quite similar and offer the same sort of functionality.

“We’re excited to bring the feedback from TikTok Notes to Lemon8 as we continue building a dedicated space for our community to share and experience photo content, designed to complement and enhance the TikTok experience,” a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch.

While TikTok didn’t provide a specific reason for shutting down the app, it’s likely that the company didn’t see much adoption for TikTok Notes and is deciding to instead push Lemon8, which had around 12.5 million global monthly active users as of December 2024.

In a notice to TikTok Notes users, TikTok says the decision to shut down the app “was not made lightly.” The notice encourages users to download and save their TikTok Notes data and “continue sharing your creativity on Lemon8.” TikTok says that “Lemon8 is a lifestyle app that offers a similar experience to TikTok Notes” but with “even more features.”

Lemon8 launched in Japan in 2020 and later expanded to markets across the U.S. and Southeast Asia. The app is similar to Instagram and Pinterest, as it lets users share slideshows and photo collections and browse content through “Following” and “For You” feeds. Lemon8 offers users access to creative tools, filters, effects, stickers, text templates, and more.

While TikTok is pushing Lemon8 as an alternative to TikTok Notes, ByteDance has also tried to position the app as an alternative to TikTok itself in the face of a potential U.S. ban.

Last November, the company made it possible for users to directly access Lemon8 with their TikTok accounts and rolled out the ability for users to cross-share photo content between the apps. The move was seen as a way for ByteDance to move creators onto the new platform without having to get them to sign up for it separately in case TikTok were to go away.

Fast-forward to today, and TikTok continues to promote Lemon8 in its app as it faces a new ban deadline of April 5.","TikTok is shutting down its Instagram competitor, TikTok Notes, on May 8. The photo-sharing app launched in testing in Canada, Australia, and Vietnam last year.

"Genetic sharing site openSNP to shut down, citing concerns of data privacy and ‘rise in authoritarian governments’",https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/01/genetic-sharing-site-opensnp-to-shut-down-citing-concerns-of-data-privacy-and-rise-in-authoritarian-governments/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 17:05:04 +0000",TechCrunch,Technology,"OpenSNP, a large open source repository for user-uploaded genetic data, will shut down and delete all of its data at the end of April, co-founder Bastian Greshake Tzovaras has confirmed.

In a blog post, openSNP’s Greshake Tzovaras attributed the decision to shutter the site due to concerns of data privacy following the financial collapse of 23andMe and the rise in authoritarian governments around the world.

Founded in 2011 by Greshake Tzovaras, along with Philipp Bayer and Helge Rausch, openSNP became an open and public repository for customers of commercial genetic testing kits, including 23andMe, to upload their test results and find others with similar genetic variations. The site had close to 13,000 users at the time of its closure announcement, making it one of the largest public repositories of genetic data. Since its founding, openSNP has touted its contributions to academic and scientific research, and identified more than 7,500 genomes.

News of openSNP’s shutdown comes in the wake of 23andMe filing for bankruptcy protection, intensifying concerns that the company’s vast banks of customers’ sensitive genetic data will be sold to the highest bidder, who may not adhere to 23andMe’s privacy commitments. The attorneys general for the states of California and New York, among others, have warned 23andMe customers to delete their data ahead of the court-approved selloff later this year.

Greshake Tzovaras also said a contributing factor in shutting down openSNP was the “rise in far-right and other authoritarian governments,” citing the removal of public data from the U.S. government’s websites soon after President Trump returned to power.

“The risk/benefit calculus of providing free and open access to individual genetic data in 2025 is very different compared to 14 years ago,” wrote Greshake Tzovaras. “Sunsetting openSNP — along with deleting the data stored within it — feels like it is the most responsible act of stewardship for these data today.”

“Always been a balancing act”

When reached by TechCrunch, Greshake Tzovaras was blunt in his decision to shut down openSNP now and not sooner.

“The ‘why now’ to me is ultimately down to there being what counts for a fascist coup in the U.S.,” Greshake Tzovaras told TechCrunch, a native of Germany.

“Seeing people being disappeared from the streets under the most dubious pretexts really can’t be called anything else,” he said, referring to the recent reports of people living in the United States, including U.S. citizens, who have been arrested in immigration raids, some whose whereabouts remain unknown.

Greshake Tzovaras said the “wholesale dismantling of scientific institutions and science itself” since January — the beginning of the second Trump administration — was a factor in the shutdown of openSNP.

“I don’t think it’s a stretch to worry about how genetic data might be soon abused to make false claims about a variety of topics, effectively bringing back a darker eugenics age,” he said.

Greshake Tzovaras said openSNP has “always been a balancing act” between its potential uses and risks, and that the site’s existence has been an “ongoing thought of whether the benefits can outweigh the risks.”

In one historical example he gave — when law enforcement used genetic data from genealogy site GEDmatch in 2018 to identify a notorious serial killer — Greshake Tzovaras said openSNP seemed at the time like it was less relevant or at risk for use by law enforcement compared to larger ancestry-specific databases. (Greshake Tzovaras confirmed to TechCrunch that notwithstanding the open and public nature of the data it stores, openSNP has never received a law enforcement request for any genetic or user data.)

Greshake Tzovaras said that compared to the first Trump administration, “the misuse of science was both qualitatively and quantitatively very different than what we see today.”

“Alongside the larger conversation about the impact of genetic data in the context of 23andMe’s bankruptcy, we decided that it’s time to pull the plug,” Greshake Tzovaras told TechCrunch.

Greshake Tzovaras also told TechCrunch that on a positive reflection, keeping openSNP running for 14 years may be his “biggest achievement.” He said openSNP ran on about $100 per month, in the face of commercial startups that have worked to monetize people’s data yet ultimately failed. Greshake Tzovaras said that in that sense, openSNP “feels like a testament to the power of open source/culture.”

The site has also contributed to research and publications “across a wide range of disciplines — from infosec/privacy all the way to biomedical studies,” said Greshake Tzovaras. Many undergraduates also benefited from having access to real-world data hosted by openSNP, he said.

“In that sense, I think our hope of ‘democratizing’ access to genomics was at least partially successful,” said Greshake Tzovaras.

The DOGE Axe Comes for Libraries and Museums,https://www.wired.com/story/institute-museum-library-services-layoffs/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 16:29:52 +0000",Wired,Technology,"The Trump administration, working in coordination with Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, has gutted a small federal agency that provides funding to libraries and museums nationwide. In communities across the US, the cuts threaten student field trips, classes for seniors, and access to popular digital services, such as the ebook app Libby.

On Monday, managers at the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) informed 77 employees—virtually the agency’s entire staff—that they were immediately being put on paid administrative leave, according to one of the workers, who sought anonymity out of fear of retaliation from Trump officials. Several other sources confirmed the move, which came after President Donald Trump appointed Keith Sonderling, the deputy secretary of labor, as the acting director of IMLS less than two weeks ago.

A representative for the American Federation of Government Employee Local 3403, a union that represents about 40 IMLS staffers, said Sonderling and a group of DOGE staffers met with IMLS leadership late last month. Afterwards, Sonderling sent an email to staff “emphasizing the importance of libraries and museums in cultivating the next generation’s perception of American exceptionalism and patriotism,” the union representative said in a statement to WIRED.

IMLS employees who showed up to work at the agency on Monday were asked to turn in their computers and lost access to their government email addresses before being ordered to head home for the day, the employee says. It’s unclear when, or if, staffers will ever return to work. “It’s heartbreaking on many levels,” the employee adds.

The White House and the Institute of Museum and Library Services did not immediately respond to requests for comment from WIRED.

The annual budget of IMLS amounts to less than $1 per person in the US. Overall, the agency awarded over $269.5 million to library and museum systems last year, according to its grants database. Much of that money is paid out as reimbursements over time, the current IMLS employee says, but now there is no one around to cut checks for funds that have already been allocated.

“The status of previously awarded grants is unclear. Without staff to administer the programs, it is likely that most grants will be terminated,” the American Federation of Government Employee Local 3403 union said in a statement.

About 65 percent of the funding had been allocated to different states, with each one scheduled to receive a minimum of roughly $1.2 million. Recipients can use the money for statewide initiatives or pass it on to local museum and library institutions for expenses such as staff training and back-office software. California and Texas have received the highest allocated funding, at about $12.5 million and $15.7 million, respectively, according to IMLS data. Individual libraries and museums also receive grants directly from IMLS for specific projects.

An art museum in Idaho expected to put $10,350 toward supporting student field trips, according to the IMLS grant database. A North Carolina museum was allotted $23,500 for weaving and fiber art workshops for seniors. And an indigenous community in California expected to put $10,000 toward purchasing books and electronic resources.","The Trump administration, working in coordination with Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, has gutted a small federal agency that provides funding to libraries and museums natio..."

Don't want to carry a wallet? Nomad’s Folio iPhone case doubles as one. The slim leather case has three card slots inside and a cash pouch. Its magnetic clasp ensures that it will stay shut to prevent your important belongings from falling out. The case also has built-in MagSafe, so you don't have to remove it to use a wireless charger.

We've crowned it “The Sturdiest Case” in our Best Apple Watch Accessories guide. It has a tough stainless steel body with a protective TPU lining and is fully waterproof. It's a great choice if you use your Apple Watch to log extreme sports or activities and need a durable case that can withstand all the elements. It's compatible with the 44/45 mm Series 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and SE.

Nomad Stand One MagSafe Charger Photograph: Julian Chokkattu

The Stand One is the top pick in our Best MagSafe Wireless Chargers guide. Its sturdy aluminum body, rubber padding, and heavy base mean you can remove your iPhone from the charger without worrying about knocking it over. The Stand One can charge your iPhone at a maximum 15-watt rate and supports the Qi2 wireless charging standard, which allows for faster, more efficient charging with any Qi2 phone.

I'm currently using this case with the M4-powered iPad Pro. The outside is made of full-grain leather while the interior has a microfiber lining to protect the display and back of the iPad. It connects magnetically, so there's no bumper around the screen. This technically means it offers less protection than previous versions, but it adds less bulk to an already lightweight and thin tablet. You can fold the cover into multiple kickstand angles, and the magnetic flap has room for your Apple Pencil.

This accessory reminds us how convenient it is to pack a single cable to charge your iPhone and Apple Watch. With an embedded charging puck on one end, you can fast-charge your Apple Watch or AirPods and any USB-C iPhone (or USB-C device) simultaneously. It has a sleek braided finish and an integrated cable tie. It's too expensive, but this sale makes it more wallet-friendly.

The CDC Has Been Gutted,https://www.wired.com/story/cdc-gutted-rif/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:15:38 +0000",Wired,Technology,"Thousands of federal employees at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were notified early Tuesday morning that they were subject to a reduction in force, or RIF, sources tell WIRED, shuttering programs that directly serve and inform the American public.

The effect was felt across the CDC, as workers in the Division of Environmental Health Science and Practice (DEHSP), the Division of Population Health, the Division of HIV Prevention, the Division of Reproductive Health, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, and the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control all received RIF notices today.

Dozens of other programs throughout the CDC’s national centers for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion; HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention; Environmental Health; Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; and the Global Health center were also impacted.

Multiple sources in the Department of Health and Human Services, the agency that houses the CDC, say that RIF notices began going out around 5 am ET on Tuesday. Employees across HHS offices arrived at buildings only to discover that their badges no longer worked, sources tell WIRED.

“I regret to inform you that you are being affected by a reduction in force (RIF) action,” reads the email to affected employees. “This RIF does not reflect directly on your service, performance, or conduct. It is being taken solely for the reasons stated in the memorandum. After you receive this notice you will be placed on administrative leave and will no longer have building access beginning Tuesday, April 1, unless directed otherwise by your leadership.” The memorandum refers to the February 11 executive order from President Donald Trump titled “Implementing the President's ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Workforce Optimization Initiative.”

“The cuts today at CDC targeted programs that address all aspects of American lives,” a source at the CDC tells WIRED. “This will lead to worse health outcomes, greater risks to the US public, and will contribute to the decline in US life expectancy … programs that were eliminated fund positions across the country, in red and blue districts.”

“There has been no effort in allowing staff to transfer projects, programs, or responsibilities,” says one CDC staffer.

These cuts will have immediate impact, experts say. At the Division for HIV Prevention, where the stated mission is “to promote health and quality of life by preventing HIV infection and reducing HIV-related illness and death in the United States,” at least half of the employees received RIF notices.

“We’re going to have patients die,” says Jade Pagkas-Bather, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Chicago who also specializes in HIV prevention. “Unnecessary, preventable death.”

Joseph Cherabie, a physician and assistant professor in the division of infectious diseases at Washington University in St. Louis, says that these cuts will have devastating consequences for HIV patients around the country, especially in rural areas: “It will be catastrophic.”

Cherabie says that states relying heavily on federal funding for public health initiatives, like Missouri, where he works, will be hit especially hard. “We're still seeing young people coming in with new HIV diagnoses, sometimes advanced HIV,” says Cherabie.","Thousands of federal employees at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were notified early Tuesday morning that they were subject to a reduction in force, or RIF, sources tell WIRED, shut..."
"Best Graphics Cards (GPUs) for PC: Nvidia, AMD, Intel",https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-graphics-cards-gpu/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:00:00 +0000",Wired,Technology,"Previous-Generation Cards

Normally, I’d recommend a previous generation card, but the RTX 40 Series and AMD 7000 cards are almost entirely out of stock or massively marked up at major retailers. There are still a few older-generation cards you can pick up relatively easily, and they’re some of the only options under $500, with newer generations only having the more expensive cards live. These cards are squarely targeting 1,920 x 1,080 for gaming, so don’t get your hopes up if you have a higher resolution or refresh rate.

AMD

Before the 50 Series launch, I was using a Sapphire Pulse 7900 XT, a card I would love to recommend now, as it served me well for two years at 3,440 x 1,440 and was under $700 in June 2023. Unfortunately, it’s currently hard to find in stock, and restocks will slow down considerably now that the new AMD cards are on the market.

Instead, I'd reach a little further down the power scale and grab an RX 7600. While I haven't spent time with this model, I’ve been historically pleased with Sapphire’s cards, and it should be fairly capable at 1080p in older titles, indie games, and great for your average evening of Rocket League or Minecraft.

Again, this card isn’t going to push 1440p, especially in newer games, and it’s going to lack some of the features you’re seeing on the latest and greatest GPUs. It should get you down the road until things have hopefully calmed down a bit, though.

Nvidia

As of early April 2025, the only previous-generation card I can consistently find in stock from Nvidia is the RTX 4060, a GPU which is also approaching two years on the market. It was a capable card at 1080p, but it doesn't keep up quite as well with today’s games, and you'll have to turn the settings down to even consider 1440p.

Of the available picks, I like the MSI GeForce RTX 4060 Ventus 2X Black, a compact card with a low power requirement that should fit into basically any modern system. MSI has a great track record for reliable, straightforward graphics cards, and this one is in stock and recently discounted.

Of the two, I think the AMD is a better buy, even though it’s performance is slightly less impressive on paper than the RTX 4060. At the sub-$500 price point, a $100 price difference can be massive, so keep an eye out for discounts to make sure you’re getting the best deal, especially as these generations begin to close out.

Buying Used

When it comes to GPUs, I'm generally a fan of buying new. Not only will you ensure you have proper warranty and RMA support if something goes wrong, but it can be hard to know if someone misused the GPU, either through heavy crypto mining, poor temperature control in their system, or artifacts and issues they didn't disclose. I'm often a fan of buying used in other areas, but with demand and prices so high, it can be hard to trust strangers.

If you do buy used, make sure to do your legwork. Local meetups via Craigslist or Reddit can have great deals and give you a chance to inspect the GPU, even if you can't make sure it boots up. You can also ask for video proof of the card running a game that also includes the serial number in one continuous shot. If you’re considering buying a used card online, make sure you’re aware of the marketplace and payment processors' return and dispute policies.

When you get the card home, inspect it immediately for any damage to the card, particularly on the PCIe fin and the power connectors. Once installed, a software tool called GPU-Z can verify the card’s hardware to make sure it matches the expected numbers for the model. Run some games on it right away, so that if anything is wrong you can reach out to the seller right away.","Previous-Generation Cards

How to Keep Your iPhone Updated These settings are based on the latest version of iOS 18, and should be applicable for most recent iPhones. Some settings may not be available on older devices or they may have different pathways depending on the model and the software version. Apple offers excellent software support for many years, so always make sure your device is up-to-date by heading to Settings > General > Software update. You can find the Settings app on your home screen.

Customize the Control Center

Swipe down from the top right of the screen to open the Control Center, and you’ll see it's more customizable than ever. You can tap the plus icon at the top left or tap and hold on an empty space to open the customization menu. Here you can move icons and widgets around, remove anything you don’t want, or tap Add a Control at the bottom for a searchable list of shortcut icons and widgets you can organize across multiple Control Center screens. You can also customize your home screen with iOS 18 to change the color and size of app icons, rearrange them, and more.

Change Your Lock Screen Buttons

You know those lock screen controls that default to flashlight on the bottom left and camera on the bottom right? You can change them. Press and hold on an empty space on the lock screen and tap Customize, then Lock Screen. Tap the minus icon to remove an existing shortcut, and tap the plus icon to add a new one. You can also change the weather and date widgets, the font and color for the time, and pick a wallpaper.

Extend Screen Time-Out

While it’s good to have your screen time out for battery saving and security purposes, I find it maddening when the screen goes off while I’m doing something. The default screen time-out is too short in my opinion, but thankfully, you can adjust it. Head into Settings, Display & Brightness, and select Auto-Lock to extend it. You have several options, including Never, which means you will have to manually push the power button to turn the screen off.

Turn Off Keyboard Sounds

The iPhone’s keyboard clicking sound when you type is extremely aggravating. Trust me, even if you don’t hate it, everyone in your vicinity when you type sure does. You can turn it off in Settings, Sound & Haptics by tapping Keyboard Feedback and toggling Sound off. I also advise toggling off the Lock Sound while you’re in Sound & Haptics.

Go Dark

Protect yourself from eye-searing glare with dark mode. Go to Settings, pick Display & Brightness, and tap Dark. You may prefer to toggle on Automatic and have it change with the sun setting, but I prefer to be in Dark mode all the time.

Change Your Battery Charge Level

If you’re determined to squeeze as many years out of your iPhone battery as possible, consider changing the charging limit. You can maximize your smartphone's battery health if you avoid charging it beyond 80 percent. The iPhone’s default is now Optimized Battery Charging, which waits at 80 percent and then aims to hit 100 percent when you are ready to go in the morning. But there’s a slider you can set to a hard 80 percent limit in Settings, under Battery, and Charging.

Set Up the Action Button

Folks with an iPhone 15 Pro model or any device in the iPhone 16 range have an Action Button instead of the old mute switch. By default, it will silence your iPhone when you press and hold it, but you can change what it does by going to Settings, then Action Button. You can swipe through various basic options from Camera and Flashlight to Visual Intelligence, but select Shortcuts if you want it to do something more interesting. If you’re unfamiliar, check out our guide on How to Use the Apple Shortcuts App.

Turn Off Apple Intelligence

Much vaunted but slightly underwhelming, Apple Intelligence isn’t fully baked yet, and we are still waiting for an improved Siri. If you prefer to opt out of certain features or opt out completely, go to Settings, Apple Intelligence & Siri, and tap on it to toggle Apple Intelligence off. If you prefer to keep select features on, you can find instructions in our How to Turn off Apple Intelligence guide.

Whether you are embarrassed by your Candy Crush addiction or risque photos, or perhaps you’ve been using the Notes app to plan your partner’s birthday party, you can hide them from prying eyes. I'm not here to judge. To protect an app, you have two options: tap and hold on the icon and select Require Face ID, then Require Face ID or Hide and Require Face ID. The first option leaves the app in place, but no one can access it without a Face ID check. If you prefer to hide the app, choose the second option and then Hide App, and it will be obscured inside a Hidden folder at the bottom of your App Library that requires a Face ID check to open.

Stop Videos Autoplaying or Looping

It can be tough to make out the dialog in some TV shows and movies, but Apple has a fix for muffled speech on your iPhone. When you’re playing a video, tap the screen to bring up the menu and select the audio icon. You can select Enhance Dialogue and choose Enhance or Enhance More to make the voices louder and clearer.

Set Up Do Not Disturb

At an absolute minimum, you should shut up your iPhone at night so it doesn’t disturb your sleep, but Apple offers a wide range of tools to automate or schedule downtime to help you focus. Go to Settings, Focus, and choose Do Not Disturb to get started. You can turn off notifications but set up exceptions so that specific contacts or apps will get through. You can also go to Screen Time and Downtime to set a specific schedule for each day.

Change Your Default Apps

You don’t have to use Safari as your browser or Apple’s Mail app for emails. You can change the default apps on your iPhone by going to Settings, Apps, and Default Apps. If you have valid alternative apps installed for Email, Messaging, Browser, and a few other categories, you can select them instead of Apple’s apps.

Keep iCloud Files Local

You can choose to keep certain files that you have synced with iCloud stored locally on your iPhone, which is handy if you want to access them when there’s no internet available. Open the Files app, go to the Browse tab, and choose iCloud Drive. You can tap and hold on any folder or file and select Keep Downloaded to keep a copy on your iPhone.

Limit App Permissions

It’s worth reviewing your app permissions and limiting them. There are a few routes to do this, but Settings, then Privacy & Security, might be the easiest. There’s a lot here, but I advise looking at Location Services and removing or reducing permissions for apps you don’t think need them. You can toggle off Precise Location for many, since an approximate location is often enough for them to function the way you want. Other apps to keep an eye on are Contacts and Photos, as both now give you the option to allow limited access.

By the way, if you want to turn off Background App Refresh to stop apps sucking down data and draining the battery when you aren’t using them, go to Settings, Apps, and choose any you don’t need to refresh unless you open them to toggle it off.

Change Siri’s Voice

Apple offers a whole range of voices for Siri now. Go to Settings, choose Apple Intelligence & Siri, and tap Voice to see a list of variations (American, Australian, British, Indian, Irish, South African) and voices (Irish Voice 2 is my pick). Just be aware that if you choose a new one, it may take a while to download.

Set a Shortcut for Your Email Address

Forget about typing out your whole email address every time. Go to Settings, General, and choose Keyboard. Tap Text Replacement and then the plus icon at the top right to set up text shortcuts, such as “eml” for your full email address, or “addy” for your mailing address. This can also work for any other text you type out frequently.

Show Notifications on Lock Screen

How do you teach an AI model to give therapy?

—James O'Donnell



On March 27, the results of the first clinical trial for a generative AI therapy bot were published, and they showed that people in the trial who had depression or anxiety or were at risk for eating disorders benefited from chatting with a bot.



I was surprised by those results. There are lots of reasons to be skeptical that an AI model trained to provide therapy is the solution for millions of people experiencing a mental health crisis. But their findings suggest that the right selection of training data is vital. Read the full story.

Recently, this field has taken some strides toward real practical applications. About 25 clinical trials of BCI implants are currently underway. And this year MIT Technology Review readers have selected these brain-computer interfaces as their addition to our annual list of 10 Breakthrough Technologies, published in January.

BCIs won by a landslide to become the “11th Breakthrough,” as we call it. It beat out three runners-up: continuous glucose monitors, hyperrealistic deepfakes, and methane-detecting satellites.

The impression of progress comes thanks to a small group of companies that are actively recruiting volunteers to try BCIs in clinical trials. They are Neuralink, backed by the world’s richest person, Elon Musk; New York–based Synchron; and China’s Neuracle Neuroscience.

Each is trialing interfaces with the eventual goal of getting the field’s first implanted BCI approved for sale.

“I call it the translation era,” says Michelle Patrick-Krueger, a research scientist who carried out a detailed survey of BCI trials with neuroengineer Jose Luis Contreras-Vidal at the University of Houston. “In the past couple of years there has been considerable private investment. That creates excitement and allows companies to accelerate.”

That’s a big change, since for years BCIs have been more like a neuroscience parlor trick, generating lots of headlines but little actual help to patients.

Patrick-Krueger says the first time a person controlled a computer cursor from a brain implant was in 1998. That was followed by a slow drip-drip of tests in which university researchers would find a single volunteer, install an implant, and carry out studies for months or years.","Implanted BCIs are electrodes put in paralyzed people’s brains so they can use imagined movements to send commands from their neurons through a wire, or via radio, to a computer.

But they also say that the right selection of training data—which determines how the model learns what good therapeutic responses look like—is the key to answering them.

Finding the right data wasn’t a simple task. The researchers first trained their AI model, called Therabot, on conversations about mental health from across the internet. This was a disaster.

If you told this initial version of the model you were feeling depressed, it would start telling you it was depressed, too. Responses like, “Sometimes I can’t make it out of bed” or “I just want my life to be over” were common, says Nick Jacobson, an associate professor of biomedical data science and psychiatry at Dartmouth and the study’s senior author. “These are really not what we would go to as a therapeutic response.”

The model had learned from conversations held on forums between people discussing their mental health crises, not from evidence-based responses. So the team turned to transcripts of therapy sessions. “This is actually how a lot of psychotherapists are trained,” Jacobson says.

That approach was better, but it had limitations. “We got a lot of ‘hmm-hmms,’ ‘go ons,’ and then ‘Your problems stem from your relationship with your mother,’” Jacobson says. “Really tropes of what psychotherapy would be, rather than actually what we’d want.”

It wasn’t until the researchers started building their own data sets using examples based on cognitive behavioral therapy techniques that they started to see better results. It took a long time. The team began working on Therabot in 2019, when OpenAI had released only its first two versions of its GPT model. Now, Jacobson says, over 100 people have spent more than 100,000 human hours to design this system.

The importance of training data suggests that the flood of companies promising therapy via AI models, many of which are not trained on evidence-based approaches, are building tools that are at best ineffective, and at worst harmful.

Looking ahead, there are two big things to watch: Will the dozens of AI therapy bots on the market start training on better data? And if they do, will their results be good enough to get a coveted approval from the US Food and Drug Administration? I’ll be following closely. Read more in the full story.

The first trial of generative AI therapy shows it might help with depression,https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/03/28/1114001/the-first-trial-of-generative-ai-therapy-shows-it-might-help-with-depression/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 17:07:35 +0000",MIT Technology Review,Technology,"Many psychologists and psychiatrists have shared the vision, noting that fewer than half of people with a mental disorder receive therapy, and those who do might get only 45 minutes per week. Researchers have tried to build tech so that more people can access therapy, but they have been held back by two things.

One, a therapy bot that says the wrong thing could result in real harm. That’s why many researchers have built bots using explicit programming: The software pulls from a finite bank of approved responses (as was the case with Eliza, a mock-psychotherapist computer program built in the 1960s). But this makes them less engaging to chat with, and people lose interest. The second issue is that the hallmarks of good therapeutic relationships—shared goals and collaboration—are hard to replicate in software.

In 2019, as early large language models like OpenAI’s GPT were taking shape, the researchers at Dartmouth thought generative AI might help overcome these hurdles. They set about building an AI model trained to give evidence-based responses. They first tried building it from general mental-health conversations pulled from internet forums. Then they turned to thousands of hours of transcripts of real sessions with psychotherapists.

“We got a lot of ‘hmm-hmms,’ ‘go ons,’ and then ‘Your problems stem from your relationship with your mother,’” said Nick Jacobson, an associate professor of biomedical data science and psychiatry at Dartmouth and the study's senior author, in an interview. “Really tropes of what psychotherapy would be, rather than actually what we’d want.”

Dissatisfied, they set to work assembling their own custom data sets based on evidence-based practices, which is what ultimately went into the model. Many AI therapy bots on the market, in contrast, might be just slight variations of foundation models like Meta’s Llama, trained mostly on internet conversations. That poses a problem, especially for topics like disordered eating.

“If you were to say that you want to lose weight,” Jacobson says, “they will readily support you in doing that, even if you will often have a low weight to start with.” A human therapist wouldn’t do that.

To test the bot, the researchers ran an eight-week clinical trial with 210 participants who had symptoms of depression or generalized anxiety disorder or were at high risk for eating disorders. About half had access to Therabot, and a control group did not. Participants responded to prompts from the AI and initiated conversations, averaging about 10 messages per day.

Participants with depression experienced a 51% reduction in symptoms, the best result in the study. Those with anxiety experienced a 31% reduction, and those at risk for eating disorders saw a 19% reduction in concerns about body image and weight. These measurements are based on self-reporting through surveys, a method that’s not perfect but remains one of the best tools researchers have.","Many psychologists and psychiatrists have shared the vision, noting that fewer than half of people with a mental disorder receive therapy, and those who do might get only 45 minutes per week.

Trump's tariff gambit will raise the stakes for an economy already looking fragile,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/01/trumps-tariff-gambit-will-raise-the-stakes-for-an-economy-already-looking-fragile.html,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 18:19:40 GMT",CNBC,Finance,"U.S. President Donald Trump speaks alongside entertainer Kid Rock before signing an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House on March 31, 2025 in Washington, DC.

President Donald Trump is set Wednesday to begin the biggest gamble of his nascent second term, wagering that broad-based tariffs on imports will jumpstart a new era for the U.S. economy.

The stakes couldn't be higher.

As the president prepares his ""liberation day"" announcement, household sentiment is at multi-year lows. Consumers worry that the duties will spark another round of painful inflation, and investors are fretting that higher prices will mean lower profits and a tougher slog for the battered stock market.

What Trump is promising is a new economy not dependent on deficit spending, where Canada, Mexico, China and Europe no longer take advantage of the U.S. consumer's desire for ever-cheaper products.

The big problem right now is no one outside the administration knows quite how those goals will be achieved, and what will be the price to pay.

""People always want everything to be done immediately and have to know exactly what's going on,"" said Joseph LaVorgna, who served as a senior economic advisor during Trump's first term in office. ""Negotiations themselves don't work that way. Good things take time.""

For his part, LaVorgna, who is now chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, is optimistic Trump can pull it off, but understands why markets are rattled by the uncertainty of it all.

""This is a negotiation, and it needs to be judged in the fullness of time,"" he said. ""Eventually we're going to get some details and some clarity, and to me, everything will fit together. But right now, we're at that point where it's just too soon to know exactly what the implementation is likely to look like.""

Here's what we do know: The White House intends to implement ""reciprocal"" tariffs against its trading partners. In other words, the U.S. is going to match what other countries charge to import American goods into their countries. Most recently, a figure of 20% blanket tariffs has been bandied around, though LaVorgna said he expects the number to be around 10%, but something like 60% for China.

What is likely to emerge, though, will be far more nuanced as Trump seeks to reduce a record $131.4 billion U.S. trade deficit. Trump professes his ability to make deals, and the saber-rattling of draconian levies on other countries is all part of the strategy to get the best arrangement possible where more goods are manufactured domestically, boosting American jobs and providing a fairer landscape for trade.

The consequences, though, could be rough in the near term.","U.S. President Donald Trump speaks alongside entertainer Kid Rock before signing an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House on March 31, 2025 in Washington, DC.

""Luigi Mangione's murder of Brian Thompson — an innocent man and father of two young children — was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America,"" Bondi said in a statement issued by the Department of Justice.

Kevin Lamarque | Reuters

Fear of rising supply chain costs as a result of President Donald Trump's new tariffs expected to be implemented Wednesday — ""Liberation Day,"" as Trump calls it — have small to medium-sized businesses turning down opportunities to expand their market share with too much economic uncertainty surrounding prices in the near future. On Tuesday, Trump said the tariffs plan is ready and the administration said the trade taxes will take effect ""immediately."" ""This is heartbreaking,"" said Anjali Bhargava, founder of Anjali's Cup, which makes retail spice packages. Bhargava's Ayurveda-inspired turmeric and chai blends — made with spices sourced from Vietnam, Thailand, Africa, and South America; tea and peppercorn from India; safran from Afghanistan; and special retail tin packaging made in China — are sold through retailers including Whole Foods, and there is little room for major price changes. ""My margins are thin,"" Bhargava said. ""The people I'm working with, independent foreign farmers securing their 2024 spice harvest, these are spices not grown at the scale I need here in the United States."" The threat of the global tariffs already have the small business owner rethinking plans for core marketing efforts. In June, the Specialty Food Association's big event takes place, the SFA Summer Fancy Food Show, but Bhargava said she may not attend because the packaging she needs for products may no longer be available at a price that can be absorbed. ""I have bootstrapped with pivots, but this is so challenging, I am at a point with my business where I can finally put my foot on the gas but now I don't know if it's going to be feasible to keep the business going,"" said Bhargava.

Four years ago, she moved manufacturing of her spice tins to China because of the cost and quality as she aimed for more market share from national retailers like Whole Foods, in addition to her online business. But tariffs that force her to create new domestic supply chains threaten growth. ""I will have to reconsider my entire retail strategy because the packing cost is unsustainable,"" Bhargava said. ""Trying to compete on the retail shelf I have beautiful retail tins, and to order tins in the U.S., the cost would be double and at astronomical quantities."" Bhargava said like countless other small business owners balancing quality and affordability on a knife's edge, the proposed tariffs threaten not just her livelihood but the very essence of what makes the U.S. marketplace diverse, authentic, and innovative. Bhargava said she has been trying to stock up on ingredients that go into the tins, within limits, but the impact of tariffs on her business affect many other companies at the same time. ""I supply to coffee companies and other smaller companies. I have warehouses and trucking services that move my product. There are many parts within the world of food,"" she said. ""I have been lucky to get this far, but my business future feels so unpredictable because of the tariffs."" Bruce Kaminstein, former owner and CEO of cleaning products company Casabella, and now an angel investor in consumer product companies, said tariffs can price companies like Bhargava's out of business, which ultimately lowers consumer choice. ""We will lose innovation and essentially the American Dream,"" said Kaminstein. ""I saw this firsthand when I sold Casabella in other countries with a high tariff. There was less product choice for consumers."" He said while he is in favor of a ""level paying field"" where U.S. brands can sell overseas ""without tariff prejudice, there needs to be a scalpel approach in executing."" ""For some industries, you cannot source everything in the United States,"" he said. Supply chains already 'tapped out' say big food companies Anjali's Cup is just one example of many companies both large and small facing the new trade war at an economic moment when the ability to take more price is getting harder. In a letter to the White House, the Consumer Brands Association, which represents approximately 90 iconic brands like Coca-Cola , McCormick Spices , and Clorox , wrote the ""current one-size-fits-all approach for protecting domestic manufacturers"" needs to be adjusted to reflect supply chain constraints, and the reality in commodity and import markets. Tom Madrecki, vice president of campaigns and special projects for the Consumer Brands Association, said its member companies are the largest employer in the domestic manufacturing sector, but they can't frontload products ahead of tariffs due to spoiling and seasonal demand trends in food. Members include General Mills , Colgate-Palmolive , and Mondelez , and Madrecki said many are in favor of ""America First"" policy and manufacture products in rural parts of the country. ""No one is contesting that,"" Madrecki said of the goal to have more domestic manufacturing. ""The issue is supply chains are incredibly tapped out, costs are high, ingredient costs are high, there is continued grocery inflation, and consumers are concerned. There is no margin on these products,"" he said. And he added that unlike the trade war during Trump's first term, at a time in the economy when inflation was much lower and costs could be absorbed, ""This time there is nowhere to absorb it. Prices will have to increase or U.S. manufacturers will bear the brunt.""

Canadian oats are a good example of a commodity market where tariffs will have a big impact on food staples. The grain is used in many cereals because there are not enough domestic oats to meet demand. Canada is the world's largest producer and exporter of oats, and over 90% of the oats milled for food in the U.S. are sourced from Canada. Growing conditions are better in Canada, Madrecki said, and due to a decline in oat acreage in the U.S. that dates all the way back to the 1940s, there is no longer a viable system for growing, storing and transporting U.S. oats from farms to mills at the scale needed for the food industry. Iowa's economy will face a big hit from tariffs on Canadian oats. ""Two of the largest oat purchasers in the world are U.S. consumer product group companies that employ thousands of workers in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,"" Madrecki said. ""Both are dependent on oats from Canada to make their food products here."" Trade and transportation costs will pile up Nick Rakovsky, CEO of DataDocks, a global supply chain scheduling system scheduling system, said the economics of trade war and the cost impacts require analysis that goes beyond the importing of products from foreign countries. ""I don't see just the topline number of the tariff,"" said Rakovsky. ""I am looking at the whole operation, the supply chain, and how everything can be affected. There is so much to consider when pivoting to a new supplier."" Companies looking to change suppliers need to review the location of the new sourcing material and where the new suppliers are located, if they are near the same ports currently being used, any new local laws and regulations, business costs associated with special licenses, quality control, and even how the freight is packed. ""If labor opens the doors of the container and it is not packed the usual way because the supplier does it different than the previous supplier, it could take a longer time to unload,"" Rakovsky said. ""This costs more money. So even the way freight is unpacked needs to be considered. In the end, a company has to ask, does pivoting to mitigate the cost of tariffs save money?"" Consumer goods such as knives are now facing a double whammy of tariffs on foreign manufacturing and foreign steel. Eunice Byun, who cofounded kitchen product company Material Kitchen seven years ago after a career at Goldman Sachs, sells her products online, and in retailers such as the Container Store, Bloomingdales and Saks. Material Kitchen's knives are made in China, Korea, and India. ""With the Trump tariffs we have had to increase prices for our steak knives (set of 3) from $90 to $110,"" said Byun. ""We also have a new product out of Finland that could now be tariffed. This is something we had never planned for. We will now have to see how that impacts pricing."" To mitigate the China tariffs, Byun was looking to move some production to Canada, but with the Trump trade war now brewing there has stopped that planning. Byun said the biggest cloud of uncertainty for her business is inventory management. ""As a growing company, you are one viral video away from your inventory being sold out. It's the hardest thing to control. We are riding this wave and we need more clarification on what the tariffs are and when regions will be impacted.""

Inside the Grizzlies' shocking firing of Taylor Jenkins,https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/44480928/no-one-was-same-page-memphis-grizzlies-shocking-firing-taylor-jenkins,"Tue, 1 Apr 2025 12:48:47 EST",ESPN,Sports,"Open Extended Reactions

Reporting by Ramona Shelburne, Tim MacMahon and Michael C. Wright

SO MUCH HAS been said in the war of words between Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green and the Memphis Grizzlies organization that it's hard to believe just how close he came to signing there as a free agent in the summer of 2023.

""Very,"" a source close to Green told ESPN, when asked how serious Green was about leaving the franchise he'd won four titles with to join the young upstarts he'd feuded with so publicly during a heated six-game playoff series a year earlier.

Green had even called Warriors coach Steve Kerr and teammates Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson to warn them that he was close to joining the Grizzlies via a lucrative sign-and-trade deal, sources told ESPN, before Warriors owner Joe Lacob and new general manager Mike Dunleavy swooped in with a four-year, $100 million extension to keep him in the Bay.

The Grizzlies were just as serious about acquiring Green, sources said, believing his experience, basketball intelligence and toughness were what the franchise needed as it tried to move past a disastrous season in which superstar point guard Ja Morant had been suspended eight games by NBA commissioner Adam Silver for brandishing a firearm in a social media post, and then the Grizzlies endured a disappointing first-round series loss to the seventh-seeded Los Angeles Lakers.

Every analysis the team did on its season called for swapping out brash, bruising forward Dillon Brooks for a more mature veteran, someone with a similar edge whom Morant and uber-talented young power forward Jaren Jackson Jr. would respect and learn from.

Green, who'd had a controversial year of his own in Golden State, was the Grizzlies' top choice and Memphis did everything it could -- even offering more than he ultimately signed for in Golden State, sources said -- to lure him away.

They wanted Green so badly, sources said, because he saw not only how good the Grizzlies were during their epic 2022 playoff series, but also how far they still had to go.

""Memphis is going to get their reality check,"" Green said after that series.

And indeed, everything that has happened in Memphis since that high-water mark in 2022 has been something of a reality check.

Ultimately, Memphis pivoted to sign veteran Derrick Rose and trade for guard Marcus Smart in an attempt to fill the void left by Brooks, whose toughness and work ethic were critical, but perhaps underappreciated, cultural tone-setters for the young Grizzlies. But the Smart deal didn't pay dividends, prompting the Grizzlies to trade him to Washington in a salary-dump deal before this year's deadline.

They'd also tried to trade for Mikal Bridges and Dorian Finney-Smith, sources said, because they knew they needed an elite wing defender to replace Brooks.

It remains to be seen whether Morant, Jackson and Desmond Bane are good enough to develop into the kind of championship contenders they once seemed destined to become.

If they are, what will it take to get them back on that track?

The short answer, the Grizzlies believe, was the decision they made that longtime coach Taylor Jenkins would not be the man to lead them there. He was fired, in one of the more shockingly timed firings in recent NBA history, just nine games before the playoffs were set to begin.

The long answer is more complicated, but it still centers on optimizing Morant. And they're running out of time to find the right leadership and direction to do so.

Despite being the winningest coach in franchise history, Taylor Jenkins was fired by Memphis on Saturday. Petre Thomas-Imagn Images

ONE DAY AFTER the team fired Jenkins, Memphis general manager Zach Kleiman stood in front of a lectern and explained his decision to fire his head coach and two assistants so late in the season.

""Urgency is a core principle of ours,"" he said. ""My expectations are clarity of direction.""

He didn't elaborate beyond those two main points.

But anyone close to the team this season knows the lack of clarity he was referring to.

Offensively, the Grizzlies had become something of a science experiment this season, offering glimpses at how several radical offensive concepts from Europe, and spacing principles found in hockey and soccer, would work in the NBA, but also how difficult it is to get full buy-in from players to implement them.

There were two architects and one supervisor -- Jenkins -- charged with blending the competing visions. One was Tuomas Iisalo, a Finnish coach who'd had a meteoric rise in Europe by implementing innovative offensive concepts around pick-and-roll schemes, pacing and offensive rebounding. Another was player development specialist Noah LaRoche, whom the Grizzlies had lured from a consulting role with the San Antonio Spurs and charged with teaching an offense that prioritized spacing and largely did away with pick-and-rolls and dribble handoffs.

Jenkins, the fifth-longest-tenured NBA coach, had never met either of the assistants before interviewing them, one source said.

Still, the Grizzlies paid a seven-figure buyout to Paris Basketball, which Iisalo (pronounced EE-za-lo) coached to a EuroCup championship last season. Memphis also gave Iisalo and LaRoche seven-figure salaries. That's especially lucrative for a second-row assistant such as LaRoche, but it's also extraordinarily unusual for a second-row assistant to have his fingerprints all over the revamping of a team's offensive system. In fact, Memphis hired LaRoche first (in May 2024) with the intention of building the staff of assistants around him, one source said. The club wouldn't bring in Iisalo until nearly two months later.

To make room for these new voices, Kleiman insisted Jenkins replace five of the assistant coaches who'd been with him throughout his time in Memphis: Brad Jones, Blake Ahearn, Scoonie Penn, Vitaly Potapenko and Sonia Raman.

Jenkins went along with the request, in an effort to be a good partner, said a league source, who added, ""Taylor shouldn't have allowed that to happen.""

The coach was so upset at the news he'd have to deliver to each of his longtime assistants, he invited each over to his house in Memphis for individual sessions.

The front office felt the new approach needed space to get off the ground, according to a source. So the club cut ties with virtually everyone associated with the team's ways of the past.

""It was a total shock because we'd already had our exit meetings and were preparing for the summer,"" one former assistant said. ""We'd all gone away for a few weeks and came back to start work again. Taylor felt so bad about it. But apparently they decided to go in another direction.""

""Going in another direction"" has become cliché -- a nice way of glossing over a difficult situation and avoiding specific issues. But in this case that's exactly what it was.

""They were going all-in on these new concepts,"" another source close to the situation said.

The immediate, unintended effect was to signal to the rest of the league, and the Grizzlies' players, that Jenkins was on thin ice.

""Players aren't stupid,"" another source said. ""They know where this is heading when you fire five assistants after the season.""

And when the job is getting players to buy into new offensive concepts, already uncomfortable for most NBA players, being taught different schemes by two assistant coaches immediately undercut Jenkins' authority.

He had overcome that already after Kleiman hired him as a first-time head coach in 2018. Jenkins had established a strong reputation as an assistant on Mike Budenholzer's staff in Atlanta and Milwaukee. But he had a nontraditional background to say the least, having graduated from the University of Pennsylvania's prestigious Wharton School of Business and eschewing a career on Wall Street for NBA coaching.

He had played high school ball and intramural basketball at Penn, but that was it. Still, players routinely said he won them over with his work ethic, basketball IQ and affable personality. It didn't hurt that he was a burly, 6-foot-3 guy who could jump in against anyone on the court.

But this was an entirely different challenge.

""The principles that we're talking about, the amount of movement that we're going to have from off of the ball is going to be significantly different,"" Jenkins said on the first day of training camp, which was held at the Ensworth School, a luxurious private school on the outskirts of Nashville.

""But some of our lead core guys that drive our offense, we have to react to how they're adopting the system and make sure that we're all fitting in the right place.""

Simplified, Memphis' offense consisted of utilizing pace with purpose and keeping the ball off the floor. If there's an easy bucket to be had, take it immediately, otherwise morph into attack mode to break down and tax the opposing defense. Some of the offense was predicated on a player breaking down his man one-on-one without a screen. Initially, Morant seemed open to the new concepts that Jenkins and Kleiman had considered a year before implementing them. ""I'm seeing a lot of different looks now,"" Morant said. ""I'm getting a lot of catch-and-shoot opportunities, back cuts, catch on the run, so I feel like it plays right into my hands and allows me to get better looks and not have to create so much.""

But when asked how he felt about playing off the ball more, which is what the new offense called for, Morant seemed less enthusiastic.

""If that's what it is,"" he said. ""Whatever coach wanna call, man, I'm fine with it.""

FOR ALL OF his individual gifts, Morant has never been a great pick-and-roll player. He's not even above average, according to ESPN Research.

Morant averages just 0.99 points per direct pick as the ball handler in his career when using an on-ball screen. That ranks 39th among 56 players to run at least 5,000 on-ball screens as the ball handler since 2019-20.

He also has just a 44.7% effective field goal percentage on jumpers when coming off an on-ball screen in his career. Only Russell Westbrook has been worse among 111 players to take at least 750 jumpers when coming off an on-ball screen since 2019-20.

The appeal of an offense that doesn't rely on pick-and-rolls is obvious for a franchise built around Morant's offensive talents.

LaRoche's system replaces pick-and-rolls with relocations. Players move away from the ball handler into space, instead of bringing their defender toward the player with the ball. The goal is to create space and quality shots in the shortest time possible.

Iisalo's expertise was to be deployed in coaching pace and the transition offense, where Morant excels.

Statistically, the results were immediate and impressive. The Grizzlies led the NBA in scoring, pace and ranked second in offensive rebounding rate as they bolted to a 35-16 record. Jackson's versatile skill set also shined, the big man averaging 22.4 points with a true shooting percentage of 59.7%, both near his career bests.

The Grizzlies set the fewest ball screens in the league by a wide margin -- 40.4 per game, almost 10 fewer than any other team, according to Second Spectrum data. The Grizzlies have run a total of 49.8 ball screens and dribble handoffs per game, the fewest in the NBA since tracking began in the 2013-14 season.

Opponents seemed confused by the new offense and Memphis was making them pay. Green seemed genuinely impressed.

""They run an unconventional offense. ... What they're doing is weird,"" Green told reporters after Golden State's home win over Memphis on Nov. 15, a little more than a month before the Grizzlies routed the Warriors by 51 points in Memphis. ""In the NBA, most rotations and patterns are pretty similar. What they're doing is, like, I haven't seen it.""

After a while, though, the novelty wore off. Opponents adjusted. Injuries mounted. Jackson sat out five games in March because of a sprained ankle. Morant has been in and out of the lineup all season, sitting out extended stretches because of a hip subluxation, sprained AC joint in his surgically repaired right shoulder and a hamstring strain that sidelined him for the final six games of Jenkins' tenure. Morant returned for Saturday's home loss to the Lakers, the first game after Jenkins' firing.

And as the sample size grew larger, other issues and side effects started to emerge. The new offense worked great against bad teams but not against good ones. Memphis' loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Feb. 8, when Morant finished with 16 points on 7-of-19 shooting, started a discouraging trend. Since that game, the Grizzlies have lost their past 11 games against teams that currently have winning records.

Perhaps most concerning was how Morant was functioning in the offense. Instead of freeing him up in transition and for moments of individual brilliance, the system was effectively taking the ball out of his hands. This season, Morant is averaging career lows in touches, average touch length and dribbles per touch this season. Morant's 22.4 points per game is his lowest scoring average since 2020-21, his second season, and his field goal percentage (.448) is the worst of his career.

That didn't sit well with him, and he voiced his frustrations publicly and privately, sources said. As the Grizzlies spiraled, losing six of eight after the All-Star break, pressure mounted to the point where one Western Conference general manager believed, until the firings, that the team would be forced to shop Morant this summer.

Jenkins tried to adjust and compromise. He started calling for more pick-and-roll sets. In March, Memphis ran 59.8 on-ball screens and handoffs per game, up significantly from the earlier months of the season.

On March 7, Morant capped a comeback road win over the injury-ravaged Dallas Mavericks by scoring 11 of his 31 points in the final 6:15. All five of his buckets down the stretch came off of pick-and-roll or isolation, the sort of dribble-centric plays the Grizzlies had gone away from for most of the season. Morant had exhibited his delight in the final minute by flexing in the paint after making a floater and dancing while pretending to play guitar after drilling a dagger 3-pointer, a stark contrast to his often dour mood this season.

""A little bit of Ja, the old Ja,"" Morant said postgame while describing those moments.

How often had Morant felt like that this season?

""Not at all,"" he said.

Had Memphis won more during this stretch, this could've gone down as a good adjustment. But the Grizzlies weren't winning much. They were regressing, offensively and defensively -- once the strength of the team. The Grizzlies rank 20th in defense since the All-Star break, giving up 117.1 points per 100 possessions. Memphis is 8-13 since the break, including a 6-7 record with Morant on the court.

The feeling within the Grizzlies' organization was that Jenkins had ""lost the locker room,"" a predictable development after the summer reconstruction of his coaching staff. The internal perception was that players, most importantly Morant, had tuned out Jenkins.

""That team has lost all of [its] swagger,"" a rival Western Conference player told ESPN. Players started to bicker in huddles. A heated exchange unfolded on the bench during a March 25 win over the Utah Jazz, when Bane shoved forward Santi Aldama during an incident that quickly went viral.

""You could just tell no one was on the same page,"" one team source said.

STILL, THE GRIZZLIES seemed to be in a relatively good place. On the day they fired Jenkins, they were fifth in the Western Conference with nine games to play and Morant about to return from his hamstring injury.

Their likely first-round opponent, the Lakers, had also been scuffling, losing four of five games in March, and struggling against younger teams such as the Chicago Bulls and Orlando Magic.

Kleiman weighed all of his options and decided the urgency to see what this core group could do together outweighed the benefits of letting Morant come back from injury and hoping Jenkins could reconnect the team and get it back on track before the playoffs. The anticipation had been that Jenkins would be fired after a first-round playoff exit. Kleiman decided there was no benefit to waiting.

So he fired Jenkins, LaRoche and assistant Patrick St. Andrews, who'd joined the staff the previous season to also work on the offense. Iisalo was promoted to interim head coach and tasked with clarifying the vision offensively, which had become muddled in its attempt at radical simplicity.

The hope is a new voice will connect with and elevate a core that has stagnated since that epic series against the Warriors in 2022.

That the Grizzlies will be rewarded, just as the Cavaliers have this season under new coach Kenny Atkinson, for sticking with a core group they believe in and making the right adjustments around the margins and at the top.

Memphis is committed to extending Jackson and Aldama this summer, sources said. And Kleiman publicly denied trade rumors and affirmed the commitment to Morant in February.

But those decisions -- and leaning into a pick-and-roll-heavy offensive system again under Iisalo -- signal Memphis' commitment to Morant is much more than lip service. There are doubts throughout the league about whether Morant, whose superstar ascension has been interrupted by off-court issues and injuries, can be the face of a contending franchise.

""Does he sell tickets? Yes,"" the rival GM told ESPN. ""Is he a top-25 player when healthy? Yes. Can he win multiple series as the best player? No. Not sure most years you can win even one. Plus he is always hurt.""

Another question remains, and that one has no easy answer:

The Grizzlies are committed to this core, but is it good enough to contend for a title?

Three years ago there was little question -- or urgency -- about that. But time moves fast in the NBA. And another ""reality check"" is coming in Memphis.

NBA coaching carousel: What's next for the Grizzlies and Kings jobs?,https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/44481123/nba-coaching-carousel-pros-cons-next-every-open-job,"Tue, 1 Apr 2025 11:55:22 EST",ESPN,Sports,"Open Extended Reactions

With two weeks to go in the NBA's regular season, there are two open head coaching jobs.

On Friday, the Memphis Grizzlies fired longtime coach Taylor Jenkins, almost three months to the day of a similarly abrupt and surprising firing in Sacramento, as the Kings dismissed Mike Brown amid a losing streak in late December.

Will more jobs open over the next several weeks? Last season, seven teams changed coaches, including three -- the Cleveland Cavaliers, Los Angeles Lakers and Phoenix Suns -- that did so after making the playoffs.

Here's our annual look at the NBA's coaching carousel, with the pros and cons of each vacancy and who could fill them:

Memphis Grizzlies

2024-25 record: 44-31 (No. 5 in West)

Previous coach: Taylor Jenkins (fired March 28; assistant Tuomas Iisalo takes over on interim basis)

Lead executive: Zach Kleiman (hired in 2019)

Positive: A promising young core

Despite suffering injuries throughout the season, the Grizzlies are still in the top five in the Western Conference standings, and with the league's fifth-best net rating -- trailing only the Oklahoma City Thunder, Cleveland Cavaliers, Boston Celtics and Houston Rockets.

With Ja Morant, Desmond Bane and Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis' core is entering its prime, which should give the Grizzlies runway to contend for the rest of this decade. Kleiman has shown that he can find talented second-round and undrafted players, giving Memphis a deep and versatile roster behind that star talent.

One NBA executive said this is a team that, if things break right, is reminiscent of the Cleveland Cavaliers last season before Kenny Atkinson came in and the franchise improved this season. That's the kind of boost Kleiman and the Grizzlies believe is possible.

Negatives: Small market, recent instability

Memphis is far from an NBA glamour market, and this team has had a lot of friction and uncertainty over the past year.

The Grizzlies fired virtually Jenkins' entire coaching staff last summer, bringing in -- among others -- Iisalo and Noah LaRoche to fill it out. Then, not only was Jenkins dismissed Friday, but so was LaRoche, who hired several player development coaches.

Now, on to the roster. In addition to numerous injuries, the Grizzlies have had some off-court issues with Morant over the years. The team had mitigated Morant's absence thanks to its impressive depth and, until Friday, Jenkins' work on the sidelines.

Now, on to the roster. In addition to numerous injuries, the Grizzlies have had a series of off-court issues with Morant over the years. The team had mitigated Morant's absence thanks to its other two stars, Jaren Jackson Jr. and Desmond Bane, its impressive depth and, until Friday, Jenkins' work on the sidelines.

Who could get the job?

Although he has only an interim tag, the expectation around the league is that Iisalo will get a long look. The Grizzlies brought him from Europe last offseason and put him on Jenkins' staff, and he will get a chance to show what he can do in the playoffs. If Iisalo is not the choice, it's hard to know Memphis' next step.

2024-25 record: 36-39 (No. 10 in West)

Previous coach: Mike Brown (fired in December; assistant Doug Christie takes over on interim basis)

Lead executive: Monte McNair (hired in 2020)

Positive: Veteran, ready-to-win talent

It's hard to project Sacramento winning a title with its roster. But a coach taking over a team with Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, Zach LaVine, Keegan Murray and Malik Monk has a chance to be competitive in each game. That gives the Kings' vacancy a boost, given the typical level of talent at open jobs.

With all of those players under team control for at least a couple of more seasons, there is some runway for them to play together, adding to the appeal for a new coach.

Negatives: Small market, decades of instability

Here's all you need to know about the Kings: Since moving to Sacramento in 1984, two coaches have had at least one full season with a winning record: Rick Adelman, who did it for eight straight seasons from 1999 to 2006, and Mike Brown the past two seasons. Sacramento has made the playoffs in three of the 33 seasons not coached by Adelman, underscoring the difficulty of this job.

The departure of assistant general manager Wes Wilcox, who took the GM job for the Utah Utes earlier this month, also points to potential further destabilization this offseason, and at least the possibility of more changes in the Kings' front office. Another drawback is the club's unwillingness to pay into the luxury tax, something owner Vivek Ranadive has avoided.

Who could get the job?

Christie has long-standing ties to the organization, going back to being a starter on those iconic teams of the early 2000s under Adelman. Christie has done a solid job the past few months since taking over for Brown. Christie will likely get a look to remain as coach, but Ranadive has repeatedly hired big names over the past decade -- including George Karl, Dave Joerger, Luke Walton and Brown -- so there's certainly a chance he pursues a bigger name this summer.","Open Extended Reactions

Williams leaves Aggies for Maryland hoops job,https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/44492960/sources-buzz-williams-hired-maryland-men-basketball-coach,"Tue, 1 Apr 2025 14:18:45 EST",ESPN,Sports,"Open Extended Reactions

Texas A&M's Buzz Williams has finalized a six-year deal to become the next coach at Maryland, sources told ESPN.

The move, announced Tuesday by Maryland, brings the veteran head coach from the SEC to the Big Ten and marks one of the highest-profile moves in this coaching carousel.

Williams has reached 11 NCAA tournaments over his 18 years as a head coach -- a run that includes five consecutive NCAA appearances at Marquette, three straight at Virginia Tech and each of the last three years at Texas A&M.

Williams has gone 373-228 as a college head coach, which includes one year at New Orleans in 2006-07. This season, Texas A&M finished 23-11, came in fifth in the rugged SEC and earned a No. 4 seed in the NCAA tournament.

Williams will replace Kevin Willard, who left for Villanova after a protracted and awkward exit from Maryland that included a blunt assessment of the program's deficiencies.

Williams' buyout to leave Texas A&M dropped to $1 million on Tuesday, per his contract. Maryland is set to receive $2 million from Villanova for Willard's departure.

Williams takes over a job with national championship expectations, as Gary Williams won the 2002 national title there. Since arriving in the Big Ten in 2014, the results haven't matched the consistent success that Williams delivered in the ACC. The Terrapins have reached the Sweet 16 just twice since joining the Big Ten, once under Mark Turgeon and under Willard this year.

Buzz Williams is a known program builder and brings familiarity with the general recruiting footprint from his time at Virginia Tech. The strength of the Maryland job lies in leveraging the DMV area, where Williams brings familiarity.

Williams was at Virginia Tech from 2014-19, going 100-69 over five seasons before leaving for Texas A&M. He led the Hokies to three consecutive NCAA tournaments for the first time in school history.

The move marks the fourth power-conference coach to leave one power league for another during this cycle, joining Willard's jump to Villanova, Sean Miller's move from Xavier to Texas and Darian DeVries jump from West Virginia to Indiana.","Open Extended Reactions

PALM BEACH, Fla. -- On the heels of the San Francisco 49ers' free agent exodus, owner Jed York spent part of Tuesday morning explaining the reasoning for the team's offseason approach publicly for the first time.

According to York, the decision to bid farewell to 17 players via free agency, trade or release and not spend much on outside free agents was largely tied to the payday coming soon for quarterback Brock Purdy.

It's why York chuckled and shrugged off the notion that he's been ""cheap"" this offseason after ranking at or near the top of the league in spending over the past five years.

""I've been called worse,"" York said. ""I get it. Fans care. You want to win. And when you're in a world where everybody is watching the NFL the first week of free agency or at least the first few days of free agency, it's a frenzy. ... When you're not overly active in that space, it gets easy to say, 'Oh, you don't want to win.' ... I don't know that, as we looked at the board, that there was somebody that we felt made that type of an impact more so than making the decision to try to go pay Brock.""

As far back as last year's league meeting in Orlando, Florida, York has maintained that he is looking forward to signing off on what will be one of the most significant raises in NFL history.

Despite Purdy's uneven 2024 season in which key members of his supporting cast were injured for much of the season and the quarterback's numbers dipped from the near-MVP-level performance he had in 2023, York remains steadfast in wanting to keep Purdy for the long haul.

As the Niners assessed their roster-building approach for this offseason after dropping to 6-11 and again failing to break through for the franchise's sixth Lombardi Trophy, York said the team solidified the decision to pay Purdy midway through last season.

On Tuesday, York called Purdy a top-10 quarterback in the league, a tacit acknowledgement that a commensurate payday is in the offing.

""I think he is,"" York said. ""I think he's great. Especially when you combine him with [coach] Kyle [Shanahan] and you combine him with what we have, and he's a heck of a quarterback. And we want him to be here for a long, long time.""

Once that decision was cemented, the 49ers forged ahead with the knowledge that the offseason would likely bring far more departures than arrivals. In the opening days of free agency, San Francisco said goodbye to key starters such as linebacker Dre Greenlaw, cornerback Charvarius Ward, safety Talanoa Hufanga and guard Aaron Banks. They also traded wideout Deebo Samuel and running back Jordan Mason and released veteran defensive linemen Leonard Floyd and Maliek Collins.

In many of those cases, the Niners took on accelerated dead money on the salary cap, a number that exceeds $86 million for 2025 but clears the ledger a bit in 2026 and beyond. Such is the price to pay when one of the oldest teams in the league has continued to try to jump through a Super Bowl window before it closes, to no avail, and wants to pay its quarterback.

""It's just a math thing,"" York said. ""When you sit down with your guys and figure out where do you want to go, what do you want to build, when you make the decision that you want to pay a quarterback that has obviously been underpaid for his first three seasons in the NFL. When you make that change, you have to make sacrifices somewhere. It's a decision that we made collectively, and we're hoping that we make somebody the highest-paid player in the history of our franchise.""

The 49ers' more prudent approach to spending this offseason has coincided with other storylines surrounding the team and the York family when it comes to adding to its sports portfolio and a potential cash infusion via the sale of a chunk of the team.

49ers Enterprises already owns the Leeds United soccer team, and it's been reported that an agreement to buy Rangers FC in Glasgow, Scotland, is also in the offing. That has left some fans wondering whether the Niners are tightening their financial belts with an eye toward preserving funds for that deal. Nothing is done on that front just yet, according to York.

""We haven't done anything there,"" York said. ""Leeds is obviously under the umbrella, but those are completely separate from the 49ers. Where we can tie brands together and sort of take our best practices of operating and things like that, [we do,] but in terms of financials, they don't overlap at all.""

Similar questions about a need for an influx of cash have also been posed in the midst of reports that the Niners are looking to sell a 10% minority stake to a private equity firm or other qualified investors.

York said his family gets approached ""probably on a weekly basis"" by parties interested in buying a piece of the 97% of the team his family controls. But he called any potential deal there a ""family asset allocation decision"" based on the wants and needs of various family members.

""It's just one of those things where if there's an opportunity that makes sense, we would always explore that, but I'm not sure what we're going to end up doing,"" York said. ""And if we do, we would try to find the right people who would help bolster everything that we're doing in and around the team, on the field, off the field and just make sure that we had good partners that are with us.""

In the meantime, a deal for Purdy remains the focus for York and the Niners. While general manager John Lynch expressed optimism Monday that a Purdy deal could be done soon despite the team's penchant for dragging such things out in recent years, York declined to put a timeline on it happening.

""I don't negotiate contracts, but any conversations that I've had with Brock have been great,"" York said. ""I feel good. When he's ready, we'll sit down and finish it. It shouldn't be that hard to do.""","Open Extended Reactions

Tush push ban vote tabled; 16 NFL teams in favor,https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44490292/sources-tush-push-ban-vote-tabled-nfl-owners,"Tue, 1 Apr 2025 14:18:45 EST",ESPN,Sports,"Ryan Clark and Shannon Sharpe react to the decision by NFL owners to table the vote on banning the tush push. (2:45)

Open Extended Reactions

PALM BEACH, Fla. -- NFL owners plan to continue discussions about the Philadelphia Eagles' short-yardage tush push play after tabling a proposal Tuesday to ban it, league officials said.

The Green Bay Packers authored the proposal, which earned the support of 16 NFL teams, two sources told ESPN's Kalyn Kahler. NFL bylaws require a minimum of 24 votes to approve a change. The topic is likely to be revisited when owners gather for their spring meeting May 20-21 in Eagan, Minnesota.

The deliberations occupied owners, general managers and coaches for much of this week's annual league meeting, mostly because it seemed to target the Super Bowl LII champions for a legal play that has been largely unstoppable over the past three seasons. The Packers' proposal was written specifically for the play, unlike most rule proposals, by prohibiting an offensive player from immediately pushing a teammate who is lined up directly behind the snapper and receives the snap.

While there were some subjective concerns about the safety risk of the tush push, the NFL's health and safety department had no data that suggested a single injury had occurred as a result of the Eagles or any other team using it. The Buffalo Bills were the only other team that used it regularly last season, and they combined with the Eagles to call 65 of the 101 tush push runs in 2024.

But committee chairman Rich McKay said last week, and reiterated Tuesday, that the league generally frowns on rule changes that target only one or two teams. The NFL prohibited players to push ball carriers for much of its history before changing its rules to allow it in 2005, citing the difficulty of officiating it. During Tuesday's meeting, McKay said, the Packers offered to change the focus on potentially reinstating the historic rule.

The distinction, sources told ESPN, is that it would also ban players from pushing ball carriers downfield and thus eliminate the focus on the Eagles' play.

""A lot of teams had a lot of views,"" McKay said. ""I think No. 1, I'm going to go back to what I said the other day, which is you'd never like any discussion in any room to be projected towards a team or two. It's never something we've ever liked doing.

""So, I think the idea [Tuesday] was, as opposed to voting on this particular proposal today, Green Bay asked, 'Could we go back and talk about reintroducing the 2004 language, study it, understand it and talk about it again when we get to May.'""

Although there was no injury data to support a ban, NFL chief medical officer Dr. Allen Sills did tell owners this week that the mechanics of the play could lead to injuries, sources told ESPN. Another source told ESPN that some owners warned their colleagues that a serious injury was just a matter of time.

The play has been enormously successful for the Eagles, who have scored 27 touchdowns and recorded 92 total first downs on it in the past three years. They scored 11 touchdowns on it with 32 first downs during their Super Bowl run in the 2024 season.

Coach Nick Sirianni said the team coaches its tush push play no differently than standard quarterback sneaks.

""I think it's an exciting play,"" Sirriani said Tuesday. ""It was really cool to hear some people talk about it this week and what they think of it, the excitement it brings to the game.""

'Everyone should be excited' - England legend Edwards appointed women's head coach,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cwy0lv33nv1o,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 16:16:20 GMT",BBC Sport,Sports,"England have appointed legendary former captain Charlotte Edwards as their new head coach.

The 45-year-old, England's all-time leading run-scorer, replaces Jon Lewis, who was sacked in March after the 16-0 Ashes hammering in Australia.

Edwards played more than 300 times for England in a 19-year career, including in excess of 200 games as captain.

In a 10-year spell in charge, Edwards won three Ashes series and both the 50-over and 20-over World Cups in 2009.

She was surprisingly sacked in 2016 and replaced by Heather Knight, who then enjoyed her own nine-year reign.

Knight was also sacked in the aftermath of the Ashes debacle but will remain as a player, now under coach Edwards.

""I cannot wait to take this team forward and drive us to success. It means the world to me to have the three lions on my chest once again,"" said Edwards.

""Leading England as captain was my life for 10 years and I will forever be passionate about this team and our legacy. We have such a talented group of players, and I am excited about working with them and improving them both as individuals and as a team.""

England are yet to name a new captain. Vice-captain Nat Sciver-Brunt has previously stated she would be interested in the role, while off-spinner Charlie Dean said she ""wouldn't say no"".

The upheaval at the top of the England team comes as a result of a review into the Ashes, led by director of women's cricket Clare Connor.

Realistically, Edwards was the standout candidate to lead a rebuild, with Connor describing her as a ""proven winner"". Following her stellar playing career, she has enjoyed considerable success as a coach.

Her Southern Vipers have been the strongest team in English domestic cricket and Edwards' Southern Brave won the women's Hundred in 2023.

Overseas, Edwards has led Mumbai Indians to two titles in three seasons at the Women's Premier League in India. In 2022, Edwards' Sydney Sixers were beaten in the final of Australia's Big Bash.

""When we drew up the criteria for the job it became apparent very quickly that Charlotte was the outstanding candidate,"" Connor added.

""She has the experience, passion and expertise to lead this team to success. The results she has achieved as a head coach in multiple environments, since retiring as one of the greatest ever England players, is testament to her relentless drive and the standards she sets for those around her.

""She is a proven winner; she has won repeatedly as a player and now as a coach. She possesses a deep knowledge of the game, both in England and across the world, and she understands the importance of creating an environment that is both challenging and supportive.""

Edwards will lead England in home white-ball series against West Indies and India this summer, building up to the 50-over World Cup in India in October.","England have appointed legendary former captain Charlotte Edwards as their new head coach.

Connor turns down GB spot after being asked to pay,https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/articles/cly8lrlnxn4o,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 09:32:15 GMT",BBC Sport,Sports,"""Representing your country is a privilege, and in athletics is earned via a qualifying process, which while not always perfect, gives everyone the same chances to gain selection,"" Connor wrote.

""Coming from a working class background I don't like the potential precedent being set where people, especially junior athletes of the future, don't have the same development or competition opportunities because of finances.

""I wish there was more transparency and honesty regarding the state of our governing bodies finances and about how our sport is being managed for this to be the position.""

In a statement, UK Athletics (UKA) said the fee is likely to be under £500 and that athletes were aware of the cost when expressing an interest in competing.

It added that as more competitions get added to the calendar it is ""impossible"" to fund all teams.

""Upon selection athletes were also advised that the earlier 'maximum contribution amount' of £1,100, was likely to be under £500 and in some cases around the £2-250 mark with a further contribution from their home country athletics organisation,"" the statement read.

""UKA feels it is better to give athletes opportunity to compete than opt not to send teams at all.""

World 1500m silver medallist and now commentator Hannah England says the idea of athletes being priced out of competing is ""really worrying and sad"" but there is just not enough money to go around.

""£20m of UK Sport funding goes to UK Athletics and it then asks athletes to pay to compete. That does not look like a good narrative,"" England told BBC 5 Live Breakfast.

""But that funding is audited and has to go towards producing Olympic medals. This is a new championship so there is no precedent for Olympians coming from that event.

""So it is either ask people to contribute or they don't send a team. And that is really hard for people to stomach.""

The Championships are one of a number of events in which UK Athletics is asking for a contribution, with up to £200 listed for July's European Under-23 Championships in Bergen.

In the policy for that event, UK Athletics says: ""We recognise that the financial commitment associated can present challenges for some athletes. To address this, the UKA Performance Pathway team is committed to working closely with athletes facing financial hardship to explore solutions that enable their involvement.""","""Representing your country is a privilege, and in athletics is earned via a qualifying process, which while not always perfect, gives everyone the same chances to gain selection,"" Connor wrote.

""In some races I can help with the strategy but he also promised me in some situations that if I'm able to be in front of Max that he wouldn't necessarily ask me to swap positions and make Max win.""

Lawson was promoted from Red Bull's second team for the 2025 season but has been sent back to Racing Bulls after struggling in the Australian and Chinese Grands Prix.

Lawson qualified 18th at the season-opening event in Melbourne and crashed out of the race. In China, he qualified last for both the sprint and the main grand prix, finishing 14th and 12th.

Verstappen appeared to disagree with Lawson's demotion by 'liking' an Instagram post, external from former F1 driver Giedo van der Garde that described it as a ""panic move"".

Tsunoda, who had previously been with Red Bull's second team since making his F1 debut in 2021, said he was yet to speak to Verstappen since replacing Lawson.

""I mentioned in the past quite a while ago but he's a bit different from how he behaves in the car and outside of the car,"" said Tsunoda.

""I'm not really worrying about the relationship we're going to have in both sides. I know what I want to do and probably how he drives and how he thinks.""

Looking ahead to his home grand prix on Sunday, Tsunoda said he will be satisfied if he can finish in the top 10.

""Obviously I want to say points or a podium or whatever,"" said Tsunoda.

""But at the same time, realistically, you think about jumping into the new car straight away with limited sessions, that's pretty tough.

The Norwegian was substituted in the 61st minute after scoring the equaliser as City went on to beat the Cherries 2-1 and reach the semi-finals.

A video was posted on social media showing the 24-year-old leaving the Vitality Stadium on crutches and with his left ankle in a protective boot.

""They told me the doctors say between five to seven weeks,"" said Guardiola. ""So hopefully the end of the season and by the Club World Cup he will be ready.

City said on Monday that Haaland would see a specialist about the injury and anticipate he ""will be fit to play a further part in the remainder of this season including this summer's Fifa Club World Cup"".

Haaland missed a penalty and two big chances on Sunday, but he turned in Nico O'Reilly's cross to level the game before Omar Marmoush scored the winner.

Rock, meanwhile, defeated Williams 7-5 in the semi-finals, before beating Cameron Menzies 8-4 in the final for his first PDC title of 2025 and fourth ever Players Championship one.

""It was probably my scoring right throughout the day. I felt like I had important checkouts at the right times. When it comes to three darts for a checkout, I've been hitting the ton-plus checkouts, thankfully,"" Rock said after victory.

Things tend to get harder with age: recovery from strenuous exercise, a big night out and in some cases achieving our goals and dreams, something 37-year-old Novak Djokovic is finding as his quest for title 100 continues.

He came so close at the weekend in Miami, reaching his eighth final there and 142nd overall. He did it without dropping a set, with movement, serve, everything on point, until he faced 19-year-old Jakub Mensik, who wasn't born when Djokovic played his first Masters 1000 event and only began playing because of the Serb, his idol. It was Mensik's first Masters 1000 final.

Firstly, a word on the winner Mensik, who was seconds away from pulling out of the tournament ahead of his first round match with a knee problem. As luck would have it the tournament referee was having lunch, so it was a trip to the physio, treatment and 'I will give it a go' in the first round.

He was clutch when he needed to be, mature beyond his years both on and off the court and moves from 54 at the start of Miami to 24 in this week's world rankings, following his straight-sets final win.

Djokovic-Murray axis finding rhythm

When it comes to Djokovic, the articles celebrating a new record and new piece of history are written and ready to go and while I'm not certain the 25th Grand Slam will be won, I'm sure the 100th title will be secured, with his next opportunity the Masters 1000 in Monte Carlo, a title he has won twice before but not since 2015.

He seems to have renewed motivation, but the task doesn't get any easier and one thing is clear: he will need to keep playing matches in order to have the sharpness and confidence to try for 25.

It was nice to see the Djokovic-Andy Murray partnership up close. They seem to have settled into a nice rhythm, with Djokovic telling us he still finds it hard to believe one of his biggest rivals is now working with him. He also said they had some time in Miami before the tennis to sit down and talk and get to know each other. Whenever I couldn't find Tim, there was a high chance he was chatting with Andy and an even higher chance the chat was golf-related!

Raducanu's renewed vigour

The women's draw went more to plan with world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka not dropping a set en route to her first title in Miami, beating world No 4 Jessica Pegula in straight sets and then telling us she would be celebrating with Tequila!

We got the chance to speak to world No 2 Iga Swiatek and I asked her about the statement she put out on social media in which she spoke of wanting to ""stop the speculation and baseless theories.""

She spoke well of the pressure she feels, especially from back home in Poland, where everything is analysed and broken down and then after the interview she came back to speak some more and it really hit me in the couple of minutes we had with the cameras off, speaking just the two of us, how tough it must be to focus solely on her tennis and the pressure she must feel to always deliver and the collective disappointment that is put on her shoulders with every defeat.

Someone who has a similar level of pressure and spotlight on her is Emma Raducanu who had a great week in Miami, winning four matches in a row for the first time since she won the US Open title, playing with a smile on her face and speaking of how happy she feels.

Great week for Emma Raducanu in Miami:

Win over top-10 player Emma Navarro.



Win over top-20 player Amanda Anisimova.



First-ever WTA 1000 quarter-final.



Back in world's top 50 (No 48) for the first time since September 2022.



She spoke of how she is putting in place people around her who make her feel safe and secure and the knock on of that is she is able to express herself on the court. Raducanu is back in the top 50, with decisions around her coaching team still to be made but a lot of positives to take forward onto the clay.

Some news that broke while we were in Miami was Russian tennis player Daria Kasatkina switching allegiance from Russia to Australia after the Australian government granted her permanent residency. Kasatkina had been splitting her time between Dubai and Spain and hadn't returned to Russia for two-and-a-half years after coming out as gay in 2022, she has also denounced the war in Ukraine.

Kasatkina, who is 14 in the latest live rankings went on to say: ""I'm really happy to start this new chapter of my life representing Australia on the big stage.""

From Miami Beach to the Monte Carlo riviera

Miami was hot, humid, wet, windy and fun, we had a celebratory dinner for Tim being named Laver Cup vice-captain organised by Gary and complete with a cake. Honourable mentions go to Adam and Patrick who came to and survived Barry's Bootcamp, which isn't for the faint hearted! We also had the opportunity to drive on the F1 racetrack that was being constructed while we were there, very slowly I might add…

For the players, it's time to shelve the hard court shoes and get ready to get dirty with the clay season upon us. There are five tournaments this week available to you on Sky Sports Tennis, and then from April 6, it's the Monte Carlo Masters 1000, a non-mandatory ATP event set in the beautiful setting of the Monte Carlo Country Club, where players in the past on centre court have had to stop play due to the clinking of glasses coming from the hospitality areas that overlook the court.

Still no Jannik Sinner as he continues to serve out his three-month suspension, but despite having played just one tournament this year, the Italian remains No 1, just over 2,500 points clear of Sascha Zverev, who missed another opportunity in Miami to close the gap, as did Carlos Alcaraz. Sinner is due to return just before the Rome Masters next month.

It is definitely worth tuning in to Sky Sports Tennis so you can get a feel for the clay and to see how the players are adapting to it. We will be back in position courtside for the 1000 events in Madrid and Rome and look forward to your company for those.

The Premier League had intended to introduce the technology into top-flight matches after the October or November international breaks this season but those plans were delayed.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sky Sports' Kaveh Solhekol explains that if this weekend's FA Cup fixtures go successfully with the use of semi-automated offsides, then it could be introduced into the Premier League by Easter.

A statement from the Premier League said: ""Semi-automated offside technology automates key elements of the offside decision-making process to support the video assistant referee (VAR).

""It provides more efficient placement of the virtual offside line, using optical player tracking, and generates virtual graphics to ensure an enhanced in-stadium and broadcast experience for fans.

""The technology maintains the integrity of the process while enhancing the speed, efficiency, and consistency of offside decision-making.

""The Premier League has worked in collaboration with PGMOL and sports data and technology company Genius Sports to develop the new semi-automated offside technology system.""

What is semi-automated offside technology and how does it work?

Semi-Automated Offside Technology (SAOT) will use up to 30 tracking cameras - operating at twice the frame-rate to usual devices used in broadcast - to help the on-field and video match officials make better and faster offside decisions.

The cameras are designed to provide more efficient placement of the virtual offside line and produce subsequent virtual graphics to help supporters in the stadium and broadcasters.

The Premier League says that computer vision cameras, powered by Genius Sports, will be installed in every Premier League stadium. These cameras around the ground will track the ball, as well as thousands of data points for each player.

When a key moment occurs, such as a penalty, a goal or a red card, the technology will track those data points to see if any attacking player involved in the build-up was offside.

If a player receives a ball in an offside position, the technology will send an alert to the officials in the VAR hub, who will then check the point of contact with the ball and inform the on-field officials.

Graphics will be made available to broadcasters, as well as being shown to fans on big screens in the stadium.

What will the impact of SAOT be?

The Premier League hopes that, on average, offside decisions will be made more than 30 seconds faster.

But it warns there could still be delays due to ""occasions of occlusion of the ball"" (it being hidden from the cameras among a group of players), ""edge decisions,"" or subjective decisions of whether an offside player was interfering with play. That would require intervention from the VAR and possibly the on-field referee in the latter instance.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol explains how semi-automated offside will be used in the next round of the FA Cup and when it might be introduced to the Premier League.

Why hasn't SAOT been used in the Premier League yet?

Semi-automated offside technology is not new to football - a version of it was used during the 2022 World Cup - but a planned autumn 2024 introduction to the Premier League never materialised.

Speaking last week, Premier League chief football officer Tony Scholes said they have been developing a different system which they believe will be a success in the long term.

He said there had been ""significant progress"" made over the last four to six weeks.

""The system that we've adopted, we believe it to be the best system,"" he said.

""We believe it to be the most accurate and the most future-proof system as well. I have to confess, given the difficulties that we had over the first few months of the season, I had severe doubts about this but the progress made over the last four to six weeks has been significant.""

Scholes insisted that introducing it with potentially only a handful of games to go would not create an integrity issue.

""The operation of semi-automated offside technology does not change the integrity of the offside law and doesn't change the integrity of decision-making,"" he said.

""We have got 100 per cent accuracy [on offside after VAR checks] this season, so it won't improve the accuracy. What it does is make the process more efficient.""","The Premier League will introduce semi-automated offside technology for the first time on Saturday April 12.

Perez reveals talks over F1 return - and verdict on Tsunoda at Red Bull,https://www.skysports.com/f1/news/12040/13339917/sergio-perez-former-red-bull-driver-confirms-talks-to-possibly-return-to-f1-grid-in-2026-and-has-say-on-yuki-tsunoda,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 17:00:00 BST",Sky Sports,Sports,"Sergio Perez says he is in talks with multiple teams over potentially returning to the Formula 1 grid in 2026.

The 35-year-old Mexican lost his Red Bull seat at the end of last year after a season of struggle, leaving him without a place on the grid for the first time since his debut in 2011 after 281 starts.

Little had been heard from him since but, amid speculation the new Cadillac outfit could target him for their debut in the sport next year, Perez has now confirmed that he has received interest from a ""few"" teams.

""If I find a project that motivates me fully to come back, where the team believe in me and where they appreciate my career, my experience and everything I can bring to a team, it would be very attractive to consider it,"" Perez told the official F1 website.

""That's why I've given myself at least six months to get all my options on the table and make a decision on what I do next with my career.""

On the interest in him, Perez added: ""There are a few very interesting projects out there. I've been approached by a few teams since Abu Dhabi. Right now, the season has started so a few things will open up in the coming months.

""We are talking to a few parties out there. Once I know all my options, I will make a decision. What is very clear to me is that I'm only coming back if the project makes sense, and it's something I can enjoy.""

'All of a sudden, people realise how difficult the car is to drive...'

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Watch back Sergio Perez's struggles in what turned out to be his final season as a Red Bull driver.

Perez said that given ""people have short memories in F1"" he has been heartened by the interest in his services, adding: ""People realise that my position was not the easiest one in F1 - and I've done extremely well overall.""

The position he refers to was the second seat at Red Bull, which has already changed hands again in the few months since his departure.

After initial replacement Liam Lawson struggled badly in the RB21 at the season's opening two rounds, being knocked out at the first hurdle in all the qualifying sessions and scoring no points, the more experienced Yuki Tsunoda has been drafted into the car next to Max Verstappen from this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix.

""Especially last year, I didn't get to show what I'm able to do as a driver,"" Perez added. ""Now, all of a sudden, people realise how difficult the car is to drive.

Image: Yuki Tsunoda now takes over what Christian Horner has regularly described as the 'hardest seat in F1'

""When I joined Red Bull, there had been great drivers who had struggled - Alex [Albon], Pierre [Gasly], they are fantastic drivers and they struggled.

""I spent so long in Red Bull that everyone forgot how difficult the car is to drive, so that was tricky.""

But Perez stressed that ""I want to see them doing well"" and said of Tsunoda: ""Yuki has the talent, has the speed and, more than that, you need the mentality to cope with it.

""I think he has the right mentality and the right attitude to cope with it.""

NFL Christmas Games 2025: Prime Video Gets One Game Alongside Netflix’s Holiday Double-Header,https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nfl-christmas-2025-streaming-amazon-prime-video-netflix-1236354032/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 18:33:49 +0000",Variety,Entertainment,"Merry Christmas to Amazon: The ecommerce giant’s Prime Video will get one Dec. 25 football game for the NFL 2025 season, joining Netflix on the streaming front, which will again have two games on the holiday.

The NFL confirmed that Prime Video will have a Dec. 25 game, as part of Amazon’s deal for “Thursday Night Football” (which currently runs through the 2033 season). But it’s not a new carve-out for Christmas: Prime Video is getting the Dec. 25 game because it falls on a Thursday in 2025. News of Prime Video’s Christmas 2025 game was first reported by Puck.

The matchups for this year’s Christmas games aren’t set yet. The league is expected to announced the 2025 NFL schedule around mid-May.

Under a three-year deal inked last year, Netflix got rights to two Christmas Day NFL games in 2024 and was guaranteed at least one game on the holiday in 2025 and 2026. Amazon, meanwhile, scored “Black Friday” games from the NFL the day after Thanksgiving starting in 2023.

On Christmas Day 2024, Netflix livestreamed two NFL games for the first time (Kansas City Chiefs vs. Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans). In addition, the Texas-Ravens game featured a lavish Beyoncé halftime show, as she performed a set from her “Cowboy Carter” album in her hometown of Houston.

Netflix said the Christmas Day NFL games averaged 24 million viewers in the U.S. Overall, the company said 65 million U.S. viewers sampled at least part of a portion of the Chiefs-Steelers and Ravens-Texans game telecasts.

Last week, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos reiterated that the streamer isn’t interested in full-season sports rights, but that he’s bullish on special events like the NFL Christmas Day games.","Merry Christmas to Amazon: The ecommerce giant’s Prime Video will get one Dec. 25 football game for the NFL 2025 season, joining Netflix on the streaming front, which will again have two games on the ..."
"Sydney Sweeney, Amanda Seyfried Share Terrifying ‘The Housemaid’ Trailer at CinemaCon: ‘We Created Some Wacky S—‘",https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sydney-sweeney-amanda-seyfried-share-housemaid-trailer-cinemacon-1236351988/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 18:30:35 +0000",Variety,Entertainment,"“The Housemaid,” Paul Feig’s adaptation of the best-selling novel by Freida McFadden, debuted a terrifying first look at CinemaCon. The film stars Sydney Sweeney as as Millie, a housemaid for a seemingly picture-perfect family. Amanda Seyfried plays her employer Nina, an emotionally erratic woman, and Brandon Sklenar as her charming husband. Things with this wealthy couple are not what they seem — a revelation that’s complicated by the fact that Millie has her own secrets she’d prefer remain hidden.

Sweeney first picked up “The Housemaid” when it topped best-seller charts and couldn’t put it down.

“I love when there’s so many unexpected twists and turns.,” Sweeney said. She appreciated that the characters were “messy” and “fucked up.”

Seyfried echoed her co-star’s enthusiasm for the shocks and surprises in store for audiences. “I got to go to places that I never expected to go to,” Seyfried said. “We reached places that I’ve never been able to as an actor…we created some wacky shit…the stuff that happened when the cameras were rolling was bananas.”

Based on the footage shared with theater owners things get very insane, very quickly. There are shots of a blood-drenched Sweeney wielding an oversized kitchen knife and later biting into a sandwich with homicidal glee, as well as lots of Sklenar and Seyfried swooning about their opulent home. The couple alternates between passionate embraces and domestic tension (an ambulance shows up in their driveway, at one point, its whirring red and blue light hinting something sinister has just taken place). All of this is set to a haunting song by Nico.

“The Housemaid” is something of a departure for Feig, who became a reliable hitmaker with comedies like “Bridemaids” and “The Heat,” though he did oversee the whip-smart thrillers “A Simple Favor” and its upcoming sequel, “Another Simple Favor.”

“I love thrillers,” Feig said. “iI’s all I watch. Ironically, I don’t watch much comedy.”

He said that both genres have similarities, because they rely on building up to a moment where tension is released.

Sweeney, who broke out with “Euphoria” and “The White Lotus,” has become a major movie star, appearing in hits like “Anyone but You” and “Immaculate.” Seyfried is an Oscar-nominee for “Mank” and an Emmy winner for her uncanny turn as Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes in “The Dropout.” Her credits include “Mamma Mia!” and “Les Misérables.” And Sklenar stars on “1923” opposite Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren,” as well as appeared alongside Meghann Fahy in this spring’s “Drop.”

McFadden has gone on to write a number of “Housemaid” novels after the first one was such a popular success. Lionsgate debuted the trailer during its presentation to theater owners at CinemaCon, an exhibition industry event that’s taking place this week in Las Vegas.

“The Housemaid” will open in theaters on December 25, 2025,.

“Let me just say you guys have a big hit coming,” Feig promised theater owners at CinemaCon.

The eight-episode series launches April 3 on Amazon Prime Video.

“The Bondsman” follows Bacon’s character Hub Halloran, “a murdered bounty hunter who’s back from the dead after being resurrected by the Devil to trap and send back demons that have escaped from the prison of Hell.”

Per the logline, “By chasing down those demons with the help and hindrance of his estranged family, Hub learns how his own sins got his soul condemned — which pushes him to seek a second chance at life, love, and country music.”

The series also stars series regulars Beth Grant (“No Country For Old Men,” “Donnie Darko”), Damon Herriman (“Once Upon A Time in Hollywood”, “Justified”), Maxwell Jenkins (“Arcadian,” “Lost In Space”) and Jolene Purdy (“The White Lotus,” “Orange Is The New Black”).

Barnes also stars in the BET+ dark comedy “Average Joe” and boasts credits like “Queer as Folk,” “The Glorias” and “Moonshot.” Kaye has appeared in “She-Hulk,” “Mo” and “To Catch a Killer.” And Ali is best known for playing Agent Ray Nadeem in Marvel’s “Daredevil” for Netflix.

“The Bondsman” was ordered straight-to-series at Prime Video back in June 2023 for eight half-hour episodes. The series hails from Blumhouse Television, Marker 96 and CrimeThink Production Company.

‘Now You See Me 4’ in the Works as Third Movie Gets Official Title: ‘Now You See Me: Now You Don’t’,https://variety.com/2025/film/news/now-you-see-me-3-title-fourth-movie-1236349342/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 18:14:13 +0000",Variety,Entertainment,"The Four Horsemen’s next cinematic sleight-of-hand has a new title: “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t.” And the thieving magicians’ third big screen heist adventure won’t be their last — a fourth film is in development with Ruben Fleischer returning to direct.

“We were so happy with the director’s cut, we’re already developing the next chapter,” Lionsgate‘s Motion Picture Group chair Adam Fogelson said Tuesday morning at CinemaCon, the annual convention for movie theater owners. “We can’t wait for audiences to discover what he’s done with the third film and thrilled he’ll be making even more magic with us.”

Before Fleischer gets to work on the fourquel, “Now You See Me 3” will open in theaters on Nov. 14. Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Isla Fisher and Morgan Freeman will reprise their roles from the first two films while Ariana Greenblatt and Rosamund Pike will join the cast.

At CinemaCon, Lionsgate brought a first-look at the third installment, a sequel to 2016’s “Now You See Me 2” and 2013’s “Now You See Me.” As a refresher, the series focuses on the thieving illusionists known as the Four Horsemen (Eisenberg, Harrelson, Franco and Fisher). However, they’re disbanded in the early moments of this third film as Eisenberg’s character tells a new generation of crooked magicians that his former comrades are dead. “To me,” he clarifies. “Things got too real for them. They gave up stuff.”

The threequel picks up with a diamond heist that involves two generations of illusionists — the Horsemen seemingly come out of retirement and join newcomers Greenblatt, Justice Smith and Dominic Sessa — to take down dangerous criminals.

“I like our odds,” Greenblatt’s character says in the trailer, which hasn’t yet been revealed to the public.

The first two films were commercial successes — and the kind of mid-budget production that traditional studios rarely greenlight these days. The original grossed $350 million while the sequel generated $334 million.

Bobby Cohen, who originally developed and has produced all the films in the series, will return to produce the new installment alongside Alex Kurtzman of Secret Hideout. Meredith Wieck will oversee the project for Lionsgate.

“Directing ‘Now You See Me: Now You Don’t’ was as much fun as making any movie in my career,” Fleischer said. “It combines two of my favorite things — heist movies and magic — and working with this incredible cast was truly magical. Of course I want to keep it going.”",The Four Horsemen’s next cinematic sleight-of-hand has a new title: “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t.” And the thieving magicians’ third big screen heist adventure won’t be their last — a fourth film is...

Amanda Seyfried and Brandon Sklenar also hit the stage for the Lionsgate presentation Tuesday to promote the psychological thriller and reveal its trailer, which has not yet been publicly shared. Hitting theaters on Christmas Day, the movie has a script from Rebecca Sonnenshine that adapts the 2022 best-selling novel from author Freida McFadden.

“Tension and scares and comedy are so wrapped together,” Feig explained about why he was drawn to a thriller despite being known for films with laughs. “It was a dream come true.”

Sweeney added that she was a big fan of the source material. “I’m a big book lover — I love reading books,” the star said. “I could not put it down. I ended up reading all three in one week.” She added about the film that recently wrapped, “There’s characters that are flawed, and they are messy.”

Seyfried emphasized how much she enjoyed filming the project and noted, “It’s gonna go to theaters — thank God.”

For his part, Sklenar said, “We just took everything to a whole other level. Andrew is pretty fucking unhinged. He’s a bit more of a force than he is in the book, I’d say.”

The Housemaid centers on Millie (Sweeney), who lands a job as a housemaid to wealthy couple Nina (Seyfried) and Andrew (Sklenar) before learning that the pair hide dangerous secrets.

Producers include Todd Lieberman for Hidden Pictures, alongside Feig and Laura Fischer for Feigco. Serving as executive producers are Sweeney, Seyfried, McFadden and Alex Young.

“I’m thrilled to have The Housemaid join our upcoming slate,” Lionsgate Motion Picture Group chair Adam Fogelson previously said in a statement from last year. “A great filmmaker and a great cast with a great script from a great book is a terrific place to start. My prior work experiences with Paul and Amanda have been nothing short of spectacular, and Sydney is as talented and compelling as can be.”

"Patty Maloney, ‘Far Out Space Nuts’ and ‘Star Wars Holiday Special’ Actress, Dies at 89",https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/patty-maloney-dead-star-wars-holiday-special-far-out-space-nuts-1236177939/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 18:30:48 +0000",Hollywood Reporter,Entertainment,"Patty Maloney, the 3-foot-11 actress who played the alien Honk on the Sid & Marty Krofft family show Far Out Space Nuts and Chewbacca’s son, Lumpy, on the long-lamented Star Wars Holiday Special, has died. She was 89.

Maloney had suffered several strokes over the years and died Monday in hospice care in Winter Park, Florida, her brother, Dave Myrabo, told The Hollywood Reporter. “For a little person growing up in a big world, she did everything she wanted to do,” he said.

Maloney did lots of work alongside the 3-foot-10 Billy Barty. The two appeared together in the Wizard of Oz feature Under the Rainbow (1981), starring Chevy Chase, and on episodes of Little House on the Prairie, Charlie’s Angels, The Love Boat, Trapper John, M.D. and more.

Far Out Space Nuts, starring Bob Denver and Chuck McCann as bumbling maintenance workers turned accidental space travelers, aired for one season (1975-76) on CBS. Maloney’s furry Honk couldn’t speak but communicated through a horn on the top of its head.

“Her extensive dancing and mime skills enabled her to convey a full range of emotions for Honk without ever speaking a word of dialogue — and with her facial features utterly obscured,” an impressed Hal Erickson noted in his 2007 book, Sid and Marty Krofft: A Critical Study of Saturday Morning Children’s Television 1969-1993.

Few were impressed with anything or anyone having to do with The Star Wars Holiday Special, which aired the week before Thanksgiving in 1978 on CBS and featured Star Wars actors alongside the likes of Bea Arthur, Art Carney and Harvey Korman.

A few years after it ran, George Lucas reportedly said, “If I had the time and a sledgehammer, I would track down every bootlegged copy of the program and smash it.”

Maloney was central to the family-friendly plot as the son of Chewbacca, played by Peter Mayhew, who had originated the role in the first Star Wars film. (The special also introduced Chewbacca’s father and wife.)

Her Lumpy costume “was made of all human hair, which made it very, very warm,” she recalled in a 2008 interview. “I remember I was doing something on The Towering Inferno, doing a stunt on that, and I had to go over after shooting all day to Stan Winston’s for the face, because he did the head — he did the make-up and the electronics in the head.”

Patricia Ann Maloney was born on March 17, 1936, in Perkinsville, New York. After her father died when she was 7, she was raised in Winter Park by her mother, Kay, and her stepfather, Jerry, an accountant.

Maloney performed with a carnival and with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus and attended the University of Florida.

In 1961, she married Joseph Vitek, a printer from Chicago, but after his death from melanoma in 1968, she was urged by friends to return to performing as a way to overcome her grief.

She served as a puppeteer in Fol-de-Pol, a 1972 filmed version of a live Krofft brothers puppet show set at a medieval fair. Barty also worked in that, and in 1976, the two were cast in a pilot for a CBS sitcom called Don’t Call Us that starred Jack Gilford and Marty King as owners of a talent agency.

She and Barty also were regulars on a 1978-79 NBC variety show hosted by The Bay City Rollers — the Kroffts produced that — before teaming again on a 1982 CBS special headlined by Cheryl Ladd.

She also appeared for the Kroffts on Brady Bunch and Donny & Marie variety shows.

Maloney’s résumé included the films The Ice Pirates (1984), Swing Shift (1984) and Ernest Saves Christmas (1988) and the series Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman; Rhoda; Buck Rogers in the 25th Century; Married … With Children; Star Trek: Voyager; Nash Bridges; and My Name Is Earl.

She also did voice work and operated the Crypt Keeper puppet on HBO’s Tales From the Crypt.

In addition to her brother, survivors include her nieces, Jennifer and Laura, and her brother-in-law, Vic.","Patty Maloney, the 3-foot-11 actress who played the alien Honk on the Sid & Marty Krofft family show Far Out Space Nuts and Chewbacca’s son, Lumpy, on the long-lamented Star Wars Holiday Special, has ..."
Broadway Box Office: George Clooney’s ‘Good Night and Good Luck’ Brings In $3.28M,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/broadway-box-office-george-clooney-good-night-and-good-luck-1236177976/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 18:29:36 +0000",Hollywood Reporter,Entertainment,"Good Night and Good Luck, starring George Clooney, was the highest grossing show on Broadway again last week, even as its grosses took a slight dip.

After breaking the record for highest weekly gross for a play, Good Night and Good Luck fell $22,558 last week, amid a few comped press performances. The play still brought in an enormous $3.28 million, and played to a more than 100 percent capacity with an average ticket price of $298.83. The play, starring and co-written by George Clooney, opens at the Winter Garden Theatre on April 3.

Othello, starring Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal, shot back up to $3.1 million last week, after experiencing a slight downturn the prior week due to press performances and an opening night. While the play received mixed to negative reviews, it is still selling well with an average ticket price of $378.73, the highest in the industry, and 100 percent capacity at the Barrymore Theatre.

Netflix’s Stranger Things: The First Shadow played its first two Broadway previews last week and brought in a strong $433,725. The show played to 100 percent capacity at the Marquis Theatre, with an average ticket price of $136.05. The play is scheduled to open April 22.

Following Good Night and Good Luck and Othello, the next highest grossing shows in the industry were Wicked, with $2.56 million, The Lion King, with $2.11 million, and Glengarry Glen Ross with $2.10 million.

Glengarry Glen Ross, starring Kieran Culkin, Bob Odenkirk and Bill Burr, achieved that gross even with a few comped press performances, in the lead up to its opening night at the Palace Theatre Monday. The David Mamet revival received mixed reviews, with THR’s David Rooney saying the play features an “ideally cast ensemble firing on all cylinders.”

Overall, grosses are up 6 percent from last week, as the industry added three new productions to the boards in the rush of April openings. In addition to Stranger Things, the new shows include Stephen Sondheim’s Old Friends, a musical revue of Sondheim’s songs at the Samuel J.

Lionsgate Debuts Explosive ‘Ballerina’ Fight (and Keanu Reeves Scene) at CinemaCon,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/ballerina-movie-ana-de-armas-lionsgate-release-1236175967/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 18:29:10 +0000",Hollywood Reporter,Entertainment,"The John Wick universe is revving up again.

Lionsgate kicked off its CinemaCon studio presentation with an extended look at the Len Wiseman and Ana de Armas collaboration Ballerina on Tuesday morning before welcoming the pair to the Colosseum stage. The director and the star chatted up the explosive action film, a spin-off of the blockbuster franchise starring Keanu Reeves, who appeared as John Wick in some of the footage that hit the big screen.

“This is by far the most physical and challenging thing I’ve ever done,” confirmed de Armas, a onetime CinemaCon Action Star of the Year. She said that her training spanned three to four months and included weapons, action and ballet training. De Armas said the sequences that required a mix of ballet flexibility and fighting proved to be “very creative and very fun to do.”

For his part, Wiseman said that he’s long been a fan of the series, particularly the cleverness and wit of the action. “In terms of what I bring to that kind of tone is I like to tease and trick the audience with the action,” said the veteran filmmaker. “By using and playing into the action tropes to just take the steering wheel and set it off course. One of the things that you can get from a really good action sequence is, ‘Holy shit, I did not expect that.’”

The CinemaCon audience responded very well to the footage that was shown, particularly a restaurant-set action sequence that finds de Armas’s character facing off with an assassin in an explosive fight that gets very physical. In another scene, Wick appears with a proposition: “You can still leave. You still have a choice.” She asks him why he didn’t leave, to which Wick answers, “I’m working on it.”

The footage followed a first-look trailer that debuted last September for a film that also includes Anjelica Huston, Gabriel Byrne, the late Lance Reddick, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Norman Reedus and Ian McShane. The script comes from Shay Hatten and Derek Kolstad.

The project has had a long road to the screen. It initially shot in 2022, and was scheduled to debut in theaters in June 2024, however last February, Lionsgate pushed the release to June 6, 2025. The extra time allowed John Wick guru Chad Stahelski to assist with upping the action working in tandem with helmer Wiseman on new sequences.

CinemaCon, the annual gathering of cinema owners and Hollywood studios, is hosted in Las Vegas by the newly rebranded Cinema United, which for decades was known as the National Association of Theatre Owners. This year’s edition runs from March 31 to April 3.","The John Wick universe is revving up again.

Luca Guadagnino Teases New ‘American Psycho’ Movie,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/american-psycho-movie-luca-guadagnino-1236177949/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 18:22:24 +0000",Hollywood Reporter,Entertainment,"Luca Guadagnino is getting ready for his new take on Patrick Bateman.

Guadagnino appeared in a video segment during Lionsgate‘s presentation at CinemaCon on Tuesday to tease his new feature version of American Psycho that adapts author Bret Easton Ellis‘ 1991 novel of the same name.

The filmmaker called American Psycho “a book that I deeply love that is something that has influenced me so much.” After confirming that the film has a script from Scott Z. Burns, Guadagnino told the crowd that he is currently in “conversation with exciting performers to play the leads.”

American Psycho was previously adapted into a film from director Mary Herron that starred Christian Bale as lead character Bateman, with Lionsgate releasing it in theaters in 2000. News of the update first broke in October.

The project hails from Frenesy Films and is said to not be a remake of the first adaptation but rather a new take on the novel. Sam Pressman of Pressman Films — whose father, Edward R. Pressman, produced the 2000 movie — is executive producing the new version.

Guadagnino’s recent features include Queer and Challengers, with After the Hunt hitting theaters later this year with leads Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield.

Burns most recently created last year’s Apple TV+ series Extrapolations, featuring an ensemble cast that includes Meryl Streep, Sienna Miller, Kit Harington, Edward Norton, Diane Lane and Daveed Diggs. Burns helmed the 2019 Amazon movie The Report and has writing credits that include The Bourne Ultimatum.

Hart pulled up in a hoodie and a backwards red fitted cap ready to drop bars. The Band of Brothas, whom he claimed to have met for the first time outside, provided instrumentation behind him.

“Only time they had somebody on Tiny Desk with no f—ing track. I’m here off the dome,” he sneered.

Droppa took it back to his 2016 What Now mixtape as he reimagined a live performance of bi-coastal cuts “ATL Rap,” “West Coast,” “Love Song” and “Don’t F–k With Dem.” The project featured superstar guest appearances from Nick Jonas, Chris Brown, Migos, Big Sean, Wale, T.I. and more.

“Every time I see people, the first thing they say is ‘Droppa where you been? When you gonna give us more?'” Hart said. For those waiting on the next Droppa release, you’re in luck as the 45-year-old teased that an album is on the way.

The Philly native didn’t break character once as Hart remained locked in as his Chocolate Droppa rap alter-ego and put forth a solid performance commanding the stage.

"Elton John on Working With Brandi Carlile on New Album: ‘She Was Capable of Pushing Me, I’m Capable of Pushing Her’",https://www.billboard.com/music/rock/elton-john-brandi-carlile-who-believes-in-angels-new-album-1235937062/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 18:25:44 +0000",Billboard,Entertainment,"There were times during the October 2023 making of their new album, Who Believes in Angels, out Friday (April 4) that Elton John wasn’t sure that he and his good friend Brandi Carlile could carry on.

Explore See latest videos, charts and news Brandi Carlile Elton John See latest videos, charts and news

For example, as tensions in parts of the Middle East exploded following Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7 and Israel’s retaliation in Gaza, John felt creating music was futile.

“Brandi was staying next door to my house, and she came around for breakfast and the newspapers were on the table,” John recalls over Zoom. “It was Gaza, the hostages, and I was in such a bad kind of funk — I just said, ‘I don’t know how we can write an album at this time when there’s so much crap going on in the world.'”

Carlile listened and then literally took their conversation and wrote “A Little Light” with such lyrics as “With the papers on your plate/ I see the sorrow in the headlines/ And the worry on your face.” The song goes on to acknowledge the difficult times, but to also find ways to “sing into the darkness.” The pair recorded the song later that day. While the album’s 10 songs don’t directly reference current events, “hopefully it’s an album that’s really ripe for these times. I really believe it is,” John says.

There were also internal challenges. John had come off his final world tour and was exhausted from the multi-year trek, at times throwing temper tantrums in the studio as the frustration to create something vibrant and new. “Nobody wants another Elton John album like the other 35 [I’ve made],” he says. “This one had to have energy, and it had to have a statement saying, ‘Listen, I’m nearly 78 and I’m gonna be really sounding powerful,’ and that’s what I wanted.

That’s why in addition to working with his longtime partner/lyricist Bernie Taupin, he brought in Carlile, “because she was capable of pushing me,” John says. “I’m capable of pushing her. And then in the middle, you’ve got Andrew Watt, who was the most excitable, incredible producer. The start of the album was difficult. I was not well, I was tired. I wasn’t in a good mood. And for the first three or four days, it was touch and go whether the album would happen.” (For the first time, John allowed cameras to capture the recording process for a forthcoming documentary.)

The turning point was creating the nearly seven-minute album opener “The Rose of Laura Nyro,” which begins with an extended majestic, driving instrumental intro before bursting into John and Carlile’s vocals intwining in tribute to the legendary songwriter.

“Bernie gave the lyric to me. We’ve both been huge Laura Nyro fans all our life. We remember lying on the floor in my parents’ apartment and listening to [Nyro’s 1968 classic] Eli and the Thirteenth Confession. She was such a great writer, and she changed tempos. I felt possessed by her when I wrote that melody,” John says. “Brandi rang me that evening from the car, as she was leaving the studio, and said, ‘You won’t believe it, but it was her birthday.’” Nyro, who died in 1997, received a writer’s credit on the song along with John, Taupin, Carlile and Watt.

From that point on, the creative process was like an express train, John says. Despite—or perhaps because of the elevated self-imposed pressure—John’s playing and vocals sound vigorous and spirited throughout the set. “You should have seen it. It was it just pours out of him,” Carlile says. “You can’t believe it when you’re witnessing it. I’ve known him for 17 years, but I never saw him like that.”

Both Taupin and Carlile delivered lyrics to John, who would set the words to melody, as he has for decades with Taupin.

Their styles are similar enough that John says it felt no different whether he was writing to Taupin’s or Carlile’s lyrics. “Not at all,” he says. That’s in part because Carlile has absorbed Taupin and John’s songs since she was 11 and Taupin is one of her biggest influences. “I really realized it on this project just how natural that is for me,” says Carlile. “The way Bernie behaved toward me during this process was incredibly inspiring. You can really tell that he’s raised daughters. He was just so kind to me, even though I was helping to do his job,” she says. “He would take me for dinner, and we’d get steaks and drink whiskey sours. We would talk about Elton and then he would give me a lyric and trust me with it.”

With Watt and Taupin, the pair wrote and recorded the album at Los Angeles’ Sunset Sound Studios over a three-week period, joined by a core band composed of Chad Smith (Red Hot Chili Peppers), Pino Palladino (Nine Inch Nails, Gary Numan and David Gilmour) and Josh Klinghoffer (Pearl Jam, Beck).

Carlile goes toe to toe with John in showing off a harder musical edge on the album, propelled by a Sunburst Les Paul electric guitar John gifted her a few years ago after she had sent John another ballad and he wanted to give her incentive to rock out.

“I know she can write those beautiful Americana songs like she’s done on all her albums,” John says. “I love those things, but I wanted to push her to say, ‘Hey, you’re capable of doing so much more and varying stuff, because there’s nothing you cannot do.’”

Carlile first played the guitar at a show at famed outdoor amphitheater The Gorge in Quincy, Washington, near where she lives. “Then I started writing songs on it and it really did change the trajectory of my songwriting,” she says.

The album’s rock feel is especially evident on second track, “Little Richard’s Bible,” a bluesy, rollicking, piano-pounding up-tempo tune with lyrics from Taupin about Little Richard, another major influence on John, that is followed by the life-affirming “Swing for the Fences,” which features a belting lead vocal by Carlile and a video that depicts a beautiful gay love story.

“Laura Nero was a gay icon, Little Richard was a gay icon — and then we got ‘Swing for the Fences,’ which is about gay people,” John says. “So the first three tracks on this album are really about stating who we are. How great we’re celebrating the people who paved the way for us!”

The openly gay John, 78, and Carlile, 43, can’t help but wonder how different their childhoods may have been if they had had a song and video like “Swing for the Fences” to guide them and make them feel less alone when they were younger.

“It would have been unbelievable to have that. Unimaginable probably for Elton,” Carlile says. “I remember the first gay kiss I ever saw on television was in the ‘90s on the Roseanne show. Her sister Jackie. And I remember there were all these warnings on Channel Five: ‘You couldn’t have this on TV.’ And I was like, think about if I had had a video like ‘Swing for the Fences’ and how for life affirming that would have been.”

The album closes with the elegiac “When This Old World Is Done With Me,” a moving piece about death sung by John. John broke down in the studio when he realized what the song was about. “It sort of crept up on me. I was writing the verse, and I think, ‘This is pretty,’ then I got to the chorus, and I realized what it was,” he says. “When you get to certain age, you think about mortality because I have children, I have [husband] David [Furnish], and I was so happy with that song. I did it all in one take, voice and piano, and it came off really well. I don’t want it to be the last song people hear about me. I’ve got more songs in me than that.”

In fact, John says he hopes this album is “the start of something,” and the pair continuing to record together, but adds there are no plans — and further states that Carlile should do her own album next, “because we don’t want to become Steve and Eydie,” he says, jokingly referring to ‘60s pop duo/married couple Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme.

John has a bigger goal for his friend that he hopes this album will help accomplish. “My ambition for her with this album was to break her internationally. She’s a well-known artist in America, but in the rest of the world, she has a lot of work to do,” he says. “She came to England last year. She played Hyde Park with Stevie Nicks. She blew people away. She did the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, got five-star reviews everywhere. And so, this album hopefully will open all those doors that she deserves to walk through and become the international artist that she should be.”

Carlile sighs appreciatively upon hearing John’s declaration, and says she knew “on some level” that was John’s plan. She’s writing a solo album now, and confesses she feels “chordically anemic” without him there to assist with the music. But almost a year and a half after finishing the album and working with John and Taupin, she is still on a high.

“I don’t think it’ll ever really catch up to how incredibly life affirming this has been for me,” she says. “I’m gonna have to really think about it for the next 10 years.”","There were times during the October 2023 making of their new album, Who Believes in Angels, out Friday (April 4) that Elton John wasn’t sure that he and his good friend Brandi Carlile could carry on.

Liza Minnelli Is Headed to the ‘Drag Race’ Season 17 Finale,https://www.billboard.com/culture/pride/liza-minnelli-drag-race-finale-lifetime-achievement-1235936979/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 17:43:07 +0000",Billboard,Entertainment,"For 17 seasons, RuPaul’s Drag Race has served as a launch pad for new pop icons. Now, the show is honoring its inspirations by recognizing EGOT winner Liza Minnelli as a cultural icon who paved the way for entertainers like RuPaul.

On Tuesday (April 1), Drag Race announced that RuPaul will present Minnelli with the show’s “Giving Us Lifetime Achievement” award during the season 17 finale on Friday, April 18. Minnelli, who has long been heralded as both an ally for the LGBTQ+ community and a gay icon, will appear on-stage during the finale to receive the award.

Minnelli — who is one of the producers of the off-Broadway hit Drag: The Musical, an original play starring several Drag Race alumni — will be the third recipient of the award, which has been given out at every season finale of the show since season 15. The first-ever award was given to fashion designer Bob Mackie (who served as the very first guest judge on Drag Race), while Cassandra Peterson (better known as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark) received the second iteration of the honor in last year’s finale.

This won’t be the first time that Drag Race has paid homage to Liza with a Z. During the show’s iconic Snatch Game challenge in season 9, Alexis Michelle delivered a hilarious impression of Minnelli that ended up winning the challenge — Billboard even ranked Michelle’s performance at No. 11 on our list of the best musical impersonations in the challenge’s format.

Meanwhile, season 17 of RuPaul’s Drag Race is currently ranked as the No. 1 show on cable among 18 to 34-year-olds, according to a press release from Paramount. Five queens — Jewels Sparkles, Lexi Love, Onya Nurve, Sam Star and Suzie Toot — remain in the competition, with two more episodes to go before the grand finale.","For 17 seasons, RuPaul’s Drag Race has served as a launch pad for new pop icons.

On Tuesday (April 1), Cardi B shared a video on Instagram announcing that she had just purchased Raising Cane’s new Moisturizing Sauce.

“Everybody always asks me, how does my skin look so beautiful, so shiny, so amazing at the age of 32, three kids, job stressin’ me out and sleepless nights?” the Bronx-bred rapper said. “Well, I’ve been using this new cream. It’s the Cane’s Moisturizing Sauce Cream. Oh my gosh.”

Cardi then proceeds to lather herself up with the tan-colored goop, rubbing it all over her face and chest before licking some residue off her fingers.

“Sorry, I’m just so hungry and the moisturizer just tastes so good,” she says.

The Cane’s sauce, in collaboration with Ipsy, was actually done as an elaborate April Fools’ prank, and fans let out sighs of relief in the comments.

“Happy April 1st, she won,” one fan wrote, while another added, “Lmao bye Cardi! Took me a sec but dang it, I ain’t no APRIL FOOL!”

The lighthearted post comes just a few days after Cardi hopped on Instagram for a more disheartening reason. Much to her dismay, Cardi showed fans on her Instagram Story that her daughter, Kulture Kiari Cephus, had scribbled all over the raper’s crocodile skin Hermés Kelly bag.

“We spent $60,000 on this purse,” Cardi said. “Look what my daughter did to my purse. Look what my daughter did to my purse. Look what my daughter did to my f–king purse… mmmmm.”

Who Was Alan Shepard? (Grades 5-8),https://www.nasa.gov/learning-resources/for-kids-and-students/who-was-alan-shepard-grades-5-8-stem/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 17:52:48 +0000",NASA,Science,"This article is for students grades 5-8.

Alan Shepard was the first American in space. He was one of NASA’s first seven astronauts. Later, he walked on the moon during the Apollo program.

What Was Shepard’s Early Life Like?

Alan Shepard was born on Nov. 18, 1923. He was born in East Derry, N.H., and grew up there. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree from the United States Naval Academy. He served on a Navy ship in the Pacific Ocean during World War II. After the war, Shepard entered flight training and earned his pilot’s wings. He graduated from Naval Test Pilot School and Naval War College. In April 1959, NASA selected Shepard as a member of its first group of seven astronauts.

What Happened on Alan Shepard’s First Spaceflight?

On May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard became the first American in space. He flew on a one-person Mercury spacecraft that he named Freedom 7. It launched on a Redstone rocket. On this flight, Shepard did not orbit Earth. He flew 116 miles high and then returned safely. The flight lasted about 15 ½ minutes. The mission was a success.

What Happened After Shepard’s First Spaceflight?

After his first flight, Shepard developed a medical problem. An inner ear problem stopped him from flying in space. NASA named Shepard as chief of the Astronaut Office. He helped select new astronauts, plan missions and make sure astronauts were ready to fly. Later, he had surgery to fix the ear problem, and he was able to fly again. Almost 10 years passed between his first and second flights.

What Happened on Alan Shepard’s Second Spaceflight?

Shepard’s second spaceflight was on the Apollo 14 mission to the moon. He was commander of a crew that included Stuart Roosa and Edgar Mitchell. The Apollo spacecraft was launched on a Saturn V (5) rocket.

On Feb. 15, 1971, Shepard and Mitchell landed on the moon. (Roosa stayed in orbit around the moon while the other two landed.) During two moonwalks, Shepard and Mitchell collected more than 100 pounds of moon rocks. They conducted scientific experiments on the lunar surface. Shepard also became the first person to hit a golf ball on the moon, showing how far it would go in the moon’s lower gravity.

What Happened After Shepard’s Second Spaceflight?

After his second flight, Shepard returned to his job as head of the Astronaut Office. He retired from NASA in 1974. Shepard worked in private business. He also did volunteer work to support education and to help people learn about spaceflight. Shepard died of leukemia in 1998.

"NASA’s SPHEREx Takes First Images, Preps to Study Millions of Galaxies",https://www.nasa.gov/missions/spherex/nasas-spherex-takes-first-images-preps-to-study-millions-of-galaxies/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 16:55:32 +0000",NASA,Science,"NASA’s SPHEREx, which will map millions of galaxies across the entire sky, captured one of its first exposures March 27. The observatory’s six detectors each captured one of these uncalibrated images, to which visible-light colors have been added to represent infrared wavelengths. SPHEREx’s complete field of view spans the top three images; the same area of the sky is also captured in the bottom three images. NASA/JPL-Caltech

Processed with rainbow hues to represent a range of infrared wavelengths, the new pictures indicate the astrophysics space observatory is working as expected.

NASA’s SPHEREx (short for Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer) has turned on its detectors for the first time in space. Initial images from the observatory, which launched March 11, confirm that all systems are working as expected.

Although the new images are uncalibrated and not yet ready to use for science, they give a tantalizing look at SPHEREx’s wide view of the sky. Each bright spot is a source of light, like a star or galaxy, and each image is expected to contain more than 100,000 detected sources.

There are six images in every SPHEREx exposure — one for each detector. The top three images show the same area of sky as the bottom three images. This is the observatory’s full field of view, a rectangular area about 20 times wider than the full Moon. When SPHEREx begins routine science operations in late April, it will take approximately 600 exposures every day.

Each image in this uncalibrated SPHEREx exposure contains about 100,000 light sources, including stars and galaxies. The two insets at right zoom in on sections of one image, showcasing the telescope’s ability to capture faint, distant galaxies. These sections are processed in grayscale rather than visible-light color for ease of viewing. NASA/JPL-Caltech

“Our spacecraft has opened its eyes on the universe,” said Olivier Doré, SPHEREx project scientist at Caltech and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, both in Southern California. “It’s performing just as it was designed to.”

The SPHEREx observatory detects infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye. To make these first images, science team members assigned a visible color to every infrared wavelength captured by the observatory. Each of the six SPHEREx detectors has 17 unique wavelength bands, for a total of 102 hues in every six-image exposure.

Breaking down color this way can reveal the composition of an object or the distance to a galaxy. With that data, scientists can study topics ranging from the physics that governed the universe less than a second after its birth to the origins of water in our galaxy.

“This is the high point of spacecraft checkout; it’s the thing we wait for,” said Beth Fabinsky, SPHEREx deputy project manager at JPL. “There’s still work to do, but this is the big payoff. And wow! Just wow!”

During the past two weeks, scientists and engineers at JPL, which manages the mission for NASA, have executed a series of spacecraft checks that show all is well so far. In addition, SPHEREx’s detectors and other hardware have been cooling down to their final temperature of around minus 350 degrees Fahrenheit (about minus 210 degrees Celsius). This is necessary because heat can overwhelm the telescope’s ability to detect infrared light, which is sometimes called heat radiation. The new images also show that the telescope is focused correctly. Focusing is done entirely before launch and cannot be adjusted in space.

“Based on the images we are seeing, we can now say that the instrument team nailed it,” said Jamie Bock, SPHEREx’s principal investigator at Caltech and JPL.

How It Works

Where telescopes like NASA’s Hubble and James Webb space telescopes were designed to target small areas of space in detail, SPHEREx is a survey telescope and takes a broad view. Combining its results with those of targeted telescopes will give scientists a more robust understanding of our universe.

The observatory will map the entire celestial sky four times during its two-year prime mission. Using a technique called spectroscopy, SPHEREx will collect the light from hundreds of millions of stars and galaxies in more wavelengths any other all-sky survey telescope.

When light enters SPHEREx’s telescope, it’s directed down two paths that each lead to a row of three detectors. The observatory’s detectors are like eyes, and set on top of them are color filters, which are like color-tinted glasses. While a standard color filter blocks all wavelengths but one, like yellow- or rose-tinted glasses, the SPHEREx filters are more like rainbow-tinted glasses: The wavelengths they block change gradually from the top of the filter to the bottom.

“I’m rendered speechless,” said Jim Fanson, SPHEREx project manager at JPL. “There was an incredible human effort to make this possible, and our engineering team did an amazing job getting us to this point.”

More About SPHEREx

The SPHEREx mission is managed by JPL for the agency’s Astrophysics Division within the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters. BAE Systems (formerly Ball Aerospace) built the telescope and the spacecraft bus. The science analysis of the SPHEREx data will be conducted by a team of scientists located at 10 institutions in the U.S., two in South Korea, and one in Taiwan. Caltech managed and integrated the instrument. Data will be processed and archived at IPAC at Caltech. The mission’s principal investigator is based at Caltech with a joint JPL appointment. The SPHEREx dataset will be publicly available at the NASA-IPAC Infrared Science Archive. Caltech manages JPL for NASA.

Thomas Ozoroski, a researcher at NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, takes icing accretion measurements in October 2024 as part of transonic truss-braced wing concept research.

In the future, aircraft with long, thin wings supported by aerodynamic braces could help airlines save on fuel costs – but those same wings could be susceptible to ice buildup. In the historic Icing Research Tunnel at NASA Glenn, scientists and engineers are testing a concept for a transonic truss-braced wing. Their goal: to collect important data to inform the design of these potential efficient aircraft of the future.

NASA Glenn can simulate icing conditions in its Icing Research Tunnel to identify potential challenges for new aircraft designs. These tests provide valuable information about how ice builds up on wings and can help identify the most critical icing conditions for safety.

Transcript

What’s Up for April? Planets at dusk and dawn, April showers, and observing a distant city of stars.

First up, in the evening sky, we begin and end the month with Jupiter and the crescent Moon shining brightly together in the western sky as sunset fades. On both April 1st and 30th, you can find the charming pair about half an hour after sunset, setting about 3 hours later.

Mars is high overhead in the south on April evenings. At the start of the month, it's directly in between bright stars Procyon and Pollux, but it moves noticeably during the month. You'll find the first-quarter moon right next to Mars on April 4th and 5th.

Moving to the morning sky, Venus has now made the switch from an evening object to a morning one. You may start to notice it rising low in the east before dawn, looking a little higher each morning through the month.

Around April 24th and 25th, you'll find Venus, Saturn, and the crescent moon gathered low in the east as dawn warms up the morning sky. Those with a clear view to the horizon might also pick out Mercury looking bright, but very low in the sky.

April brings shooting stars as Earth passes through one the streams of comet dust that create our annual meteor showers. The Lyrids are a modest meteor shower that peaks overnight on April 21st and into the morning of the 22nd. You can expect up to 15 meteors per hour near the peak under dark skies.

The Lyrids are best observed from the Northern Hemisphere, but can be seen from south of the equator as well. View them after about 10:30pm local time until dawn, with the best viewing around 5 a.m. The waning crescent moon will rise around 3:30am, but at only 27% full, it shouldn't interfere too much with your meteor watching. For the best experience, face roughly toward the east, lie down in a safe, dark place away from bright lights, and look straight overhead. Meteors can appear anywhere in the sky, and some Lyrids can leave bright trails that last for a few seconds after they've passed.

NASA studies meteors from the ground, in the air, and from orbit to forecast meteor activity and protect spacecraft, and to understand the composition of comets and asteroids throughout our solar system.

April offers a chance to observe a truly distant wonder – a globular cluster known as “M3.” It’s a vast collection of stars that lies 34,000 light-years from Earth in our galaxy's outer reaches. Astronomer Charles Messier discovered this object in 1764, while searching for new comets. Realizing it wasn’t one, he added it to his list of interesting objects that were not comets, which today we know as Messier’s catalog.

Through binoculars, Messier 3, or M3, appears as a small, fuzzy, star-like patch of light. With a small telescope, you'll see a more defined glow with a slightly grainy texture. And with telescopes 8 inches or larger, the cluster begins to resolve into hundreds of individual stars.

Now, globular clusters contain some of the oldest stars in the universe, often over 10 billion years old. Unlike open clusters like the Pleiades, which sit within the Milky Way's spiral arms, globular clusters are found in the galaxy's halo, orbiting far above and below the Milky Way's disk. Our galaxy has around 150 confirmed globular clusters. M3 itself is probably 11 to 13 billion years old and contains around half a million stars. And it's relatively easy to spot in April under dark skies with binoculars or a small telescope.

Finding M3 starts with the Big Dipper. Facing east, use the Dipper’s handle to “arc to Arcturus,” the fourth-brightest star in the night sky. From there, look higher in the sky to find the star Cor Caroli located here to the west of the Dipper’s handle. It’s about as bright as this star in the Dipper’s cup. M3 is located roughly a third of the way from Arcturus to Cor Caroli. With binoculars or a finder scope, sweep within this area until you spot a faint, round glow.

M3 is an excellent target for beginners and seasoned observers alike. Whether using binoculars or a telescope, you'll be rewarded with a view of one of the oldest objects in our galaxy.

Four private astronauts launch on first human mission to fly over the poles,https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/four-private-astronauts-launch-on-first-human-mission-to-fly-over-the-poles/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 16:23:10 +0000",Ars Technica Science,Science,"Four adventurers suited up and embarked on a first-of-a-kind trip to space Monday night, becoming the first humans to fly in polar orbit aboard a SpaceX crew capsule chartered by a Chinese-born cryptocurrency billionaire.

The private astronauts rocketed into orbit atop a Falcon 9 booster from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 9:46 pm EDT Monday (01:46 UTC Tuesday). Instead of heading to the northeast in pursuit of the International Space Station, the Falcon 9 and Dragon spacecraft departed Launch Complex 39A and arced to the southeast, then turned south on a flight path hugging Florida's east coast.

The unusual trajectory aligned the Falcon 9 with a perfectly polar orbit at an inclination of 90 degrees to the equator, bringing the four-person crew directly over the North or South Pole every 45 minutes.

Chun Wang, born in China and now a citizen of Malta, paid SpaceX an undisclosed sum for the opportunity to fly to space and bring three hand-picked crewmates along with him. SpaceX likely charged between $100 million and $200 million for the flight. Chun made his fortune as a crypto pioneer, co-founding F2Pool, once the world's largest bitcoin mining company. He named his mission Fram2 in honor of the Norwegian exploration ship Fram used for polar expeditions at the turn of the 20th century.

No one saw Earth's poles from space in the more than 400 human spaceflight missions preceding Fram2. The closest any crew mission has gotten to the poles was the Soviet Union's Vostok 6 mission in 1963, when Valentina Tereshkova's spacecraft reached a latitude of 65.1 degrees.

Something new

Chun didn't want to pay for a mission to repeat the well-trodden path to the International Space Station, or fly in a higher-altitude orbit as SpaceX's Polaris Dawn mission did last year with billionaire commander Jared Isaacman and three crewmates. He wanted to try something new.

""Jared spent a lot of effort trying to fly as high as possible because he has a pilot background,"" Chun said in response to a question from Ars. ""But here on this mission, we have a group of polar explorers. We will do this from an explorer's perspective. I don’t want to repeat the same mission profile again and again. I have less interest in flying to ISS because every previous mission flies to the ISS again, again and again.""

Chun was inspired by Isaacman's first foray into orbit on the Inspiration4 mission in 2021. That was the first fully commercial human spaceflight to low-Earth orbit without any significant government involvement. Isaacman is President Trump's nominee to become the next NASA administrator.","Four adventurers suited up and embarked on a first-of-a-kind trip to space Monday night, becoming the first humans to fly in polar orbit aboard a SpaceX crew capsule chartered by a Chinese-born crypto..."

Wind Cave’s rocks fluoresce under black light

South Dakota's Wind Cave gets its name from the flow of air moving continually through its many passages and equalizing the atmospheric pressure between the air inside and outside—almost like the cave is ""breathing."" Its rock and mineral formations also boast a unique chemistry that fluoresces when exposed to black light, according to talks presented at the spring meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Diego. That fluorescence could shed light on how life can thrive in extreme environments, including that of Jupiter's moon, Europa.

University of Northern Iowa astrobiologist Joshua Sebree and several students have been mapping new areas of Wind Cave (as well as other caves in the US), recording the passages, rock formations, minerals, and lifeforms they encounter in the process. They noticed that under UV light, certain parts of Wind Cave took on otherworldly hues, thanks to different concentrations of organic and inorganic fossilized chemical compounds. Those areas seem to indicate where water once flowed, carrying minerals into the cave from the surface 10,000 to 20,000 years ago, according to their analysis of the fluorescent spectra. Sebree et al. found that Wind Cave was likely carved out by waters rich in manganese, producing zebra stripes that glow pink under UV light, revealing the calcites that grew within as a result of those waters.","It's a regrettable reality that there is never time to cover all the interesting scientific stories we come across each month.

The first flight of Isar Aerospace’s Spectrum rocket lasted just 40 seconds,https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/europes-first-private-launch-company-is-learning-to-embrace-failure/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 16:26:54 +0000",Ars Technica Science,Science,"The first flight of Isar Aerospace's Spectrum rocket didn't last long on Sunday. The booster's nine engines switched off as the rocket cartwheeled upside-down and fell a short distance from its Arctic launch pad in Norway, punctuating the abbreviated test flight with a spectacular fiery crash into the sea.

If officials at Isar Aerospace were able to pick the outcome of their first test flight, it wouldn't be this. However, the result has precedent. The first launch of SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket in 2006 ended in similar fashion.

""Today, we know twice as much about our launch system as yesterday before launch,"" Daniel Metzler, Isar's co-founder and CEO, wrote on X early Monday. ""Can't beat flight testing. Ploughing through lots of data now.""

Isar Aerospace, based in Germany, is the first in a crop of new European rocket companies to attempt an orbital launch. If all went according to plan, Isar's Spectrum rocket would have arced to the north from Andøya Spaceport in Norway and reached a polar orbit.

But officials knew there was only a low chance of reaching orbit on the first flight. For this reason, Isar did not fly any customer payloads on the Spectrum rocket, designed to deliver up to 2,200 pounds (1,000 kilograms) of payload mass to low-Earth orbit.

Duck and cover

The launch began with liftoff from Andøya Spaceport at 12:30 pm local time (6:30 am EDT, or 10:30 UTC). The rocket's nine engines, burning a mix of liquid propane and liquid oxygen, throttled up to generate more than 150,000 pounds (675 kilonewtons) of thrust as Spectrum began a vertical climb from the launch pad.

The first visual sign of trouble appeared about 15 seconds later as the 92-foot-tall (28-meter) rocket started to wobble on its axis. The exhaust plume from Spectrum's main engines also appeared to oscillate, suggesting that the rocket's steering system was trying to keep it on track.

After a brief struggle, the rocket lost control and somersaulted, the engines shut down, and the vehicle fell into the sea about 40 seconds after launch. With its propellant tanks nearly full, the rocket's impact created a brilliant fireball and mushroom cloud over the craggy snow-covered landscape of Andøya, which means ""island of the ducks"" in Norwegian.",The first flight of Isar Aerospace's Spectrum rocket didn't last long on Sunday.

FBI raids home of prominent computer scientist who has gone incommunicado,https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/03/computer-scientist-goes-silent-after-fbi-raid-and-purging-from-university-website/,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 19:41:44 +0000",Ars Technica Science,Science,"A prominent computer scientist who has spent 20 years publishing academic papers on cryptography, privacy, and cybersecurity has gone incommunicado, had his professor profile, email account, and phone number removed by his employer, Indiana University, and had his homes raided by the FBI. No one knows why.

Xiaofeng Wang has a long list of prestigious titles. He was the associate dean for research at Indiana University's Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering, a fellow at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a tenured professor at Indiana University at Bloomington. According to his employer, he has served as principal investigator on research projects totaling nearly $23 million over his 21 years there.

He has also co-authored scores of academic papers on a diverse range of research fields, including cryptography, systems security, and data privacy, including the protection of human genomic data. I have personally spoken to him on three occasions for articles here, here, and here.

“None of this is in any way normal”

In recent weeks, Wang's email account, phone number, and profile page at the Luddy School were quietly erased by his employer. Over the same time, Indiana University also removed a profile for his wife, Nianli Ma, who was listed as a Lead Systems Analyst and Programmer at the university's Library Technologies division.

As reported by the Bloomingtonian and later the Herald-Times in Bloomington, a small fleet of unmarked cars driven by government agents descended on the Bloomington home of Wang and Ma on Friday. They spent most of the day going in and out of the house and occasionally transferred boxes from their vehicles. TV station WTHR, meanwhile, reported that a second home owned by Wang and Ma and located in Carmel, Indiana, was also searched. The station said that both a resident and an attorney for the resident were on scene during at least part of the search.","A prominent computer scientist who has spent 20 years publishing academic papers on cryptography, privacy, and cybersecurity has gone incommunicado, had his professor profile, email account, and phone..."
NASA’s Curiosity rover has found the longest chain carbon molecules yet on Mars,https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/nasas-curiosity-rover-has-found-the-longest-chain-carbon-molecules-yet-on-mars/,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 11:00:32 +0000",Ars Technica Science,Science,"NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover has detected the largest organic (carbon-containing) molecules ever found on the red planet. The discovery is one of the most significant findings in the search for evidence of past life on Mars. This is because, on Earth at least, relatively complex, long-chain carbon molecules are involved in biology. These molecules could actually be fragments of fatty acids, which are found in, for example, the membranes surrounding biological cells.

Scientists think that, if life ever emerged on Mars, it was probably microbial in nature. Because microbes are so small, it’s difficult to be definitive about any potential evidence for life found on Mars. Such evidence needs more powerful scientific instruments that are too large to be put on a rover.

The organic molecules found by Curiosity consist of carbon atoms linked in long chains, with other elements bonded to them, like hydrogen and oxygen. They come from a 3.7-billion-year-old rock dubbed Cumberland, encountered by the rover at a presumed dried-up lakebed in Mars’ Gale Crater. Scientists used the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument on the NASA rover to make their discovery.

Scientists were actually looking for evidence of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins and therefore key components of life as we know it. But this unexpected finding is almost as exciting. The research is published in Proceedings of the National Academies of Science.

Among the molecules were decane, which has 10 carbon atoms and 22 hydrogen atoms, and dodecane, with 12 carbons and 26 hydrogen atoms. These are known as alkanes, which fall under the umbrella of the chemical compounds known as hydrocarbons.

It’s an exciting time in the search for life on Mars. In March this year, scientists presented evidence of features in a different rock sampled elsewhere on Mars by the Perseverance rover. These features, dubbed “leopard spots” and “poppy seeds,” could have been produced by the action of microbial life in the distant past, or not. The findings were presented at a US conference and have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal.",NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover has detected the largest organic (carbon-containing) molecules ever found on the red planet.
